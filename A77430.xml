            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Grand Seignior's</hi> Empire borders upon the <hi>Republick of Venice</hi> towards <hi>Sclavonia,</hi> and that of <hi>Raguza,</hi> ſituate upon the ſhoar of the <hi>Adriatick Sea.</hi> This latter <hi>Republick</hi> is their Tributary, and can preſerve it ſelf no longer than it ſhall pleaſe the <hi>Grand Seignior;</hi> for beſides that the City is not ſtrong of it ſelf, its ſituation is very diſadvantageous, being built at the foot of a great <hi>Mountain,</hi> from whoſe top they may by rolling down of huge ſtones overwhelm them, and ſoon become their abſolute <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Maſters.</hi> Within a quarter of a league of <hi>Raguza,</hi> there is a <hi>Port,</hi> or <hi>Harbor,</hi> named <hi>Santa Cruz,</hi> of a wonderfull capacity, wherein a numerous fleet may winter with much ſafety.</p>

            <p>Alſo the <hi>Republick of Venice,</hi> though great by <hi>Sea,</hi> and who get moſt of their riches by Trade and Navigation, muſt ſoon have declined, and could not but under the favour and protection of a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull Fleet have ſent any forces to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend ſeveral of their Iſlands and places of importance; as <hi>Corfu, Zant</hi> and <hi>Cepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Turk</hi> and <hi>Perſian</hi> are frequently in debate, and at war, as well by reaſon of their Vicinity which creates frequent occaſions of quarrel, as out of the emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and jealouſie each <hi>Prince</hi> hath of his own grandeur; beſides the contrariety in <hi>Religion,</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> calling the <hi>Perſians</hi> Hereticks, and the <hi>Perſians</hi> eſteeming them ſo too, and yet both of them hold <hi>Mahomet</hi> for a <hi>Prophet</hi> and the <hi>Meſſenger of God,</hi> not differing in their Belief, but

               <note place="margin">Second.</note> the overplus (which makes another Treaſury) is left under the keeping of an <hi>Eunuch</hi> whom they call <hi>Aſenadar Baſchy,</hi> and is one of the three principal <hi>Eunuchs</hi> who are near the perſon of the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> and who never ſtir out of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> or <hi>Palace,</hi> unleſs to attend and follow their <hi>Maſter.</hi> The ſums of Moneys which are put into the cuſtody of this <hi>Eunuch,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in Caſh ſtill and are never employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unleſs the moſt urgent affairs require it, and then oftentimes the <hi>Treaſurers</hi> of the <hi>Port</hi> are fain to oblige themſelves to make it up again with moneys from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.</p>
            <p>The third Treaſury, is that of the <hi>Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Third.</note> which is very great for the following reaſons:
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:152568:7"/> The <hi>Turkiſh Empire,</hi> as I have ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is wonderfully large; the devotion of that people is great; it is true they have not amongſt them either <hi>Biſhopricks</hi> or <hi>Abbeys,</hi> they have onely very ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous <hi>Temples</hi> which ſerve them for <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes.</hi> The <hi>Ottoman Emperors,</hi> their <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaws,</hi> their principal <hi>Officers,</hi> and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number of other devout people, have founded and given much of their wealth to theſe <hi>Temples,</hi> (which we will from henceforward call <hi>Pariſhes</hi>) which are worth an hundred or ſix ſcore thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crowns yearly revenue; thoſe that ſerve in them are few in number, and their allowance ſo moderate, that they muſt make hard ſhift to live thereon, ſo that there is much money remaining, which is put into the treaſury of the <hi>Church,</hi> whereof the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> is the principal <hi>Guardian:</hi> yet cannot he make uſe of it, but when urgent occaſions of State, and the maintenance of their Faith makes it neceſſary, unleſs he will offend his Conſcience, and violate the Laws of the <hi>Empire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Revenues of the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> are very vaſt, ariſing as well from the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary duties paid by the common people, as thoſe contingent ſums that are brought
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:152568:7"/> into his <hi>Coffers:</hi> he is heir to all his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and to every one that receives pay from him, if they die without Children; but if they leave Daughters he takes but two thirds of the inheritance and ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the deceaſed, holding the place of Son.</p>
            <p>As there comes frequent complaints againſt ſuch as are in eminent Offices and employments of truſt, that they may have pretence to fleece them and get their Eſtates, they ſoon conclude them guilty, and ſeize upon all they have to apply it to the uſe and benefit of the <hi>Grand Seignior.</hi> This injuſtice and cruelty is of dangerous conſequence; as is that likewiſe of appropriating the revenues of their <hi>Temples</hi> to their own private advantage.</p>
            <p>To reſume what I was ſaying of the methods they purſue when they have conquer'd any <hi>Kingdom</hi> or <hi>Province;</hi> after they have given to their <hi>Temples,</hi> and to thoſe that ſerve in them what they think to be neceſſary, and alſo to ſuch numbers of Souldiers deſigned for the guard of their new Conqueſts, they apply one part of it to the maintenance of the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> or <hi>Governor:</hi> they do the ſame for <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> to the <hi>Judges,</hi> and other <hi>Officers,</hi> all which is diſtributed by the <hi>Treaſurer</hi> of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:152568:8"/> the <hi>Province,</hi> who is accountable for the ſame, and who ought every three months to bring the remainder into the <hi>Grand Seignior's Coffers,</hi> upon pein of corporal puniſhment and confiſcation of his Goods.</p>
            <p>Speaking of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Thunis,</hi> I had forgot to mention with what facility the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> might infeſt, yea ruine the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Sicilia,</hi> and by the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent cruiſings of his <hi>Galleys</hi> moleſt the coaſts of <hi>Calabria,</hi> ſince hard by <hi>Thunis</hi> there is a <hi>Gulf</hi> which beats at the feet of the ruines of <hi>Goletta</hi> and the <hi>Cape</hi> of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> able at all ſeaſons to contain a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val force: Near the ſaid <hi>Gulf</hi> there is a very ſafe and a very capacious <hi>Harbor,</hi> named <hi>Porto Farino,</hi> diſtant from the ſaid <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Sicilia</hi> not above fourſcore miles, and therefore may be ſailed over in a very ſhort time. Should the <hi>Turk,</hi> powerfull as he is, keep always a good number of <hi>Galleys</hi> in readineſs in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>Gulf</hi> of <hi>Thunis,</hi> or the above-named <hi>Porto Farino,</hi> they might ſoon be upon the <hi>Sicilian</hi> ſhoar, keep them in perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al alarms, which would ruine the trade of all ſuch as ſail upon the coaſt; hinder the <hi>Sardinians</hi> in their traffick, whilſt the <hi>Iſlands</hi> of <hi>Malta, Corſica, Majorca,</hi> and <hi>Minorca,</hi> would be liable to the ſame trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and inconveniencies.</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:152568:8"/>
            <p>But the ambition of the <hi>Ottoman Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> and the inveterate hatred they bear againſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> having cut them out ſo much work on that ſide, they have neglected the opportunities they had to doe theſe and other miſchiefs to the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean Princes;</hi> beſides that their <hi>Religion</hi> obliges them to believe that there is more merit in killing one <hi>Perſian Heretick</hi> in war, than if they ſlew threeſcore and ten <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> ſo that their great zeal and rage carries them more that way. And this is that which hath in ſome meaſure ſecured the <hi>Peace</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs hath but too many times felt the weight and force of this too potent <hi>Monarchy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the year 1593. the Treaties of <hi>Peace</hi> made between the <hi>Emperour Rodulphus</hi> and the <hi>Grand Seignior Amurath,</hi> about the intereſt of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Hungary,</hi> (wherein both of them had ſhares) were broken, and they fell out, and that Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was converted into a dangerous and bloody war; the event proved pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and ſhamefull to the ſaid <hi>Emperour,</hi> by the ſignal loſs of a <hi>Battel,</hi> the <hi>City, Caſtle</hi> and <hi>Province</hi> of <hi>Agria;</hi> it was terrible and bloody for the vaſt numbers of Chriſtians ſlain upon the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:152568:9"/> place, or taken and carried away captive by the common enemies of our Faith: It was in <hi>Anno</hi> 1596 that this diſaſter hapned.</p>
            <p>We muſt obſerve that this War com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced during the reign of <hi>Amurath,</hi> and ended in the reign of <hi>Mahomet</hi> his <hi>Son,</hi> who had the reputation and honour of being at the head of his Army when this Victory was gained; but he did not make uſe of all that advantage which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had put into his hands; for inſtead of wintering and putting part of his Army into the Cities under his command, which are numerous on that frontier, he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and loſt the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of making himſelf aſſuredly <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Maſter</hi> of <hi>Vienna,</hi> and of all <hi>Hungary;</hi> which gave the <hi>Emperour</hi> leiſure and means to prevent his utter ruine.</p>
            <p>In thoſe times the intereſt of the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> made them begin to beſtir themſelves, and they were making ready to joyn their forces with the <hi>Emperour</hi>'s, foreſeeing and apprehending that after the loſs and ruine of <hi>Hungary,</hi> they muſt needs fall too; yet, notwithſtanding this their fears of the power of the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Tartary</hi> their neighbour, and ſome other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles mentioned elſewhere then obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their deſign.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:152568:9"/>
            <p>Before I propoſe the certain means whereby the <hi>Chriſtian Princes</hi> may ruine this great <hi>Monarchy,</hi> I ſhall ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of its dreadfull force and ſtrength, that ſo ſuch as ſhall take the pains to reade this brief Diſcourſe may know, what great power they have, and what forces they can bring together to trouble and moleſt <hi>Europe,</hi> and by conſequence what care ought to be taken to hinder the diſmal effects. Now we ought not to let them know their own advantages any longer, but prevent and attaque them betimes, which cannot be without a <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral union of the Christian forces:</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I diſcover the methods they ought to take, it will be neceſſary, (as I ſaid above) to repreſent what the power of the <hi>Turk</hi> is, as well by <hi>Sea</hi> as by <hi>Land,</hi> that it may be apparent they are not eaſie to be beaten, or overcome, but by the way preſcribed.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Empire</hi> hath under its command five and forty <hi>Vice-Roys,</hi> as well in <hi>Europe,</hi> as <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> the names and titles of them in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> tongue are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the <hi>European Chriſtians,</hi> (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs by ſuch as live under their ſubjection) which is the reaſon why I ſhall not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly nominate them, but refer my
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:152568:10"/> ſelf to the capitulations between our <hi>Kings</hi> and the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> (which were not long ſince tranſlated and ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied) under the reigns of <hi>Amurath, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi> &amp;c. who had ſo much vanity, that in order to make known their grandeur and power they cauſed them all to be named and inſerted in thoſe agreements.</p>
            <p>There are in this number of five and forty <hi>Vice-Roys</hi> two of them that have each his five and twenty <hi>Provinces</hi> under his command, and in every <hi>Province</hi> they have a <hi>Governour</hi> whom they entitle <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacbey,</hi> as much as to ſay <hi>Lord of the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard,</hi> or <hi>Banner,</hi> nay ſome of them, whom I ſhall only name, as the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> hath ſeven and twenty <hi>Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;</hi> the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> of <hi>Buda</hi> eighteen, the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> of <hi>Natolia</hi> ſeventeen, the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> of <hi>Arzeron</hi> ſeventeen, the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> of <hi>Babylon</hi> twenty four, the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> of <hi>Baſeras</hi> twenty one, the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> of <hi>Diar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bekir</hi> nineteen, the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> of <hi>Grand Cairo</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> more than the above named; but not to be too tedious, I ſhall omit to mention the reſt.</p>
            <p>The Forces of all theſe <hi>Provinces</hi> as well of Foot as Horſemen, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding thoſe that ought to ſerve at Sea, are very formidable: the number of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:152568:10"/> them is above eight hundred thouſand men, 'tis true they are not ſo brave and generous as they have formerly been, by reaſon of the <hi>Venality</hi> that hath crept in amongſt them.</p>
            <p>During the reign of <hi>Sultan Amurath,</hi> (a covetous <hi>Prince</hi>) he began to receive great Preſents from thoſe to whom he gave conſiderable Commands; this autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s to doe the like on their parts, which diſorder does ſtill continue if not increaſe amongſt them, ſo that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing is ſold to any perſon that bids higheſt, even to the meaneſt and moſt ſervile employments. Now we muſt conſider that thoſe that have them may not hold them above a year or two, and having dearly bought the ſhort liv'd pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, they lay moſt intolerable burthens upon the people to re-imburſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>The beginning of this diſorder is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to <hi>Sultan Solyman,</hi> who tenderly loving his Siſters and Daughters, inſtead of marrying them, according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of other <hi>Emperours</hi> his Predeceſſors, to the <hi>Governors</hi> of <hi>Provinces</hi> far diſtant from his <hi>Port,</hi> would needs beſtow them on his <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s reſiding near him, that he might the oftner and more conveniently
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:152568:11"/> ſee them. The expences of theſe <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes</hi> being very great, being entertained within the <hi>Court</hi> of the <hi>Emperour</hi> their own <hi>Father</hi> or <hi>Brother,</hi> and their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands not having ſufficient Eſtates to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray the charges, they began underhand to take bribes either in <hi>Money</hi> or <hi>Jewels</hi> of ſuch whom they recommended or hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to Offices and Commands, being well aſſured the intereſt of their Wives would ſave their Heads in caſe they ſhould happen to be diſcovered and accuſed: theſe failures have been followed by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others of no leſs importance.</p>
            <p>I ſaid, in the beginning of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, that as the <hi>Ottoman Emperours</hi> went on with their Conqueſts, they ſettled in every <hi>Province</hi> a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Souldiers, as well foot as horſe to guard and defend the Countrey; as alſo to make uſe of elſewhere upon any caſe of neceſſity that might happen to the <hi>Empire.</hi> As for their <hi>Horſemen,</hi> whom they call <hi>Timars Eſpahi,</hi> excepting only five and twenty, or thirty thouſand who attend conſtantly at the <hi>Grand Seignior's Port,</hi> and ſome others who are quarter'd at <hi>Grand Cairo</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and at <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> who are paid every three months in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy money at ſo much a day, ſome more,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:152568:11"/> ſome leſs than the others, their pay being encreaſed according to the merit of their Service: all the reſt are <hi>Timariots,</hi> whom we ſhall henceforward call<note n="*" place="margin">Or Eſtates ſettled upon condition of furniſhing certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of armed Men and Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for Service.</note> 
               <hi>Commandry's,</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly as their <hi>Commandry's</hi> are in value, thoſe that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy them are obliged to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the Field, with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number of men well ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and mounted, or elſe to remain at home to guard and defend the Countrey, as they ſhall be appointed.</p>
            <p>When theſe <hi>Commandry's</hi> were firſt eſtabliſhed, the revenues of them were not ſo great as they are at preſent, for as their <hi>Empire</hi> hath encreaſed, ſo theſe are likewiſe augmented ſo much, that there are ſome of them worth ten or twelve thouſand Crowns a year: the <hi>Baſſas,</hi> the <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> the <hi>Mutes,</hi> the <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> and even thoſe <hi>Women</hi> the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> makes uſe of, have an exact ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the names of all the beſt of them in each <hi>Province,</hi> (as we have of <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Pariſhes</hi> in this <hi>Kingdom</hi>) and when ever any vacancy falls, they beg them, and put in ſome <hi>Domeſtick</hi> Servant or Slave of their own, that they may

            <p>All the form of Juſtice obſerved in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſuch perſons to death, as have been raiſed to the ſupremeſt dignities of the <hi>Empire,</hi> is, that the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> makes a demand in writing of the <hi>High Prieſt</hi> of their <hi>Law,</hi> whom they call <hi>Mufty,</hi> what puniſhment that ſlave or ſubject deſerves who commits felony againſt his <hi>Prince</hi> and his <hi>Empire,</hi> enumerating all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of his ſuſpicions and diſcontents, which he puts down for truths.

            <p>This <hi>Empire</hi> will be able for a long time without a miracle to reſiſt both by Sea and Land the forces that ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire its ruine, unleſs they be ſuch as I have computed they ought to be in the following part of this Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>For beſides the great numbers of the <hi>Militia,</hi> who live under their command, and who are in pay, as well in times of Peace as War, all others able to bear Arms are obliged to oppoſe the enemies of their Faith to the laſt drop of their blood; but when it is upon account on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of an offenſive war, or deſign of far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conqueſt, then only thoſe are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to march that are under pay, they call that general obligation, <hi>Nefirham.</hi> There is no Prince in <hi>Europe,</hi> nor in any other part of the world within our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that hath better conveniencies to make himſelf ſtrong at Sea, than this ſame; he is <hi>Lord</hi> of the <hi>Black-Sea</hi> beyond <hi>Trebizond,</hi> the Countrey thereabouts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wonderfully populous, and wealthy, and infinite Foreſts, the Villages and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes being obliged ſome to cut down the Woods for the building of <hi>Gallies,</hi> others to ſaw and hew it, beſides people appointed to make Nails, Ropes, Sails; then have they <hi>Ship-wrights</hi> that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:152568:17"/> them, together with all other the ſeveral workmen requiſite, and in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſufficient, and all this without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſing one penny. Theſe people are bound to perform the ſaid duties when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is required, upon which conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration they are exempted from the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any taxes or impoſts, and their Children from being taken up as Tribute by the <hi>Commiſſaries,</hi> delegated for that purpoſe; thus a <hi>Galley,</hi> which amongſt us would coſt to build eight or ten thouſand Crowns, does not ſtand the <hi>Grand Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior</hi> in above one or two thouſand: as for the Cannon ſuch Galley is to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd with, there are infinite numbers made at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> there being ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſpacious places filled with them, they having all the neceſſary materials in their own Countrey for the compleating of them. As for the men that ſail and row theſe <hi>Galleys,</hi> the natural <hi>Turks</hi> pay no taxes, but only when they are to ſend out Fleets to Sea, then they are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute as much as the <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> this duty is called <hi>Avaris,</hi> or <hi>Avania,</hi> and is raiſed, as I ſaid, indifferently upon all that are under the power of the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> in the ſame manner as they do the Pioneers in <hi>France;</hi> that is, that every
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:152568:17"/> Pariſh (according to the quantity of Fires there are in each of them) ought to furniſh one, two or three men, and the <hi>Judges</hi> are bound, at the diſcretion of the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> to bring him the quantity of men to which their circuit is liable, or elſe five and thirty Crowns, in lieu of each man, as he pleaſes, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the number he intends to ſet forth, either calls for the men, or ſends for the money: To this end he makes uſe of <hi>Turks,</hi> not of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> for his greater ſecurity. By this method in leſs than two months time, he can have enough to Man out two or three hundred <hi>Galleys;</hi> their <hi>Mariners</hi> are not of the beſt, although there be great numbers in conſtant pay for that uſe and ſervice, but to help them in caſe of neceſſity they take the Sea-men out of their other Ships, though they have no great skill in managing of <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys,</hi> their navigation being very different. That which makes them the more ſecure is, that they ſeldom go to Sea but in the Summer time, whilſt the ſeaſon is calm, and little ſubject to ſtorms and the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes of winds and waves, otherwiſe they would often run the hazard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loſt, for want of ſufficient knowledge in maritime affairs.</p>
            <pb n="30" facs="tcp:152568:18"/>
            <p>As for the Souldiers they put on board their Galleys, there are ſome that have <hi>Commandries</hi> along the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Shore, chiefly towards the <hi>Morea;</hi> who ſend out one <hi>Captain</hi> of the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> one <hi>Lieutenant</hi> and other Officers, with fifty, three-ſcore, or an hundred <hi>Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries</hi> for each <hi>Galley,</hi> according to the undertaking they have in hand: the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners</hi> are named <hi>Azabiſtan;</hi> they are well furniſhed with Cannon and want not for Ammunitions, but generally their Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are unskilfull; and indeed that Art is very difficult, unleſs they have been uſed to Navigation, there being a great deal of skill in pointing of Guns upon the Sea, becauſe of the motion of the Veſſels and Galleys, which are ever in agitation more or leſs. As for their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions they have them in great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, their Countries abounding much in Wheat, Rice, Fleſh, Butter, Oil, Cheeſe, and other proviſions neceſſary for Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation: they can endure a great deal, and that without any trouble, for from their infancy are they accuſtomed to live ſoberly. Their Galleys are not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered nor encumbred like ours: for firſt they have not the uſe of Wine, they carry no great ſtore of Salt-meats, as we
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:152568:18"/> do, beſides many other things; wherefore their Galleys are much lighter than ours, cleaner, and the Rowers put to leſs labour and pains in their work, by reaſon the very Souldiers take a pleaſure in helping of them; thus are they more fit and nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble either to follow or to fly away from an enemy if they be over-matched.</p>
            <p>In the Harbor or Port of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> a great number of Galleys are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily to be ſeen riding in the <hi>Arſenal,</hi> as we ſee our Horſes tyed in rows within our Stables. Whenever the <hi>Grand Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior</hi> reſolves to have a force at Sea, he can in leſs than two years time ſet out three hundred Galleys.</p>
            <p>As for round Veſſels, or as we call them, tall Ships, they have but few fit to make men of war: they have only five or ſix great Gallions which ſerve to carry Wood into <hi>Egypt</hi> proper for build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which they fetch from the <hi>Black-Sea,</hi> and from <hi>Egypt</hi> they bring back proviſions to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> as well for the uſe of the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi>'s Kitchin as for the inhabitants: <hi>viz.</hi> great quantities of <hi>Rice, Sugars, Spices</hi> and other Victuals and Merchandize: of theſe <hi>Gallions</hi> they make ſome uſe in caſe of need. There may be found alſo about ſome forty or
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:152568:19"/> fifty ſail of <hi>Merchant</hi> Ships, which being well fitted may ſerve as a Convoy to the reſt of the Fleet. They can likewiſe equip five or ſix <hi>Mahones</hi> (which are a ſort of <hi>Galeaſſes</hi>) but they have but few men fit to manage them; they have ſome <hi>Chriſtian Subjects</hi> whom they keep in the <hi>Iſland</hi> of <hi>Rhodes</hi> in a great Town na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Lindo,</hi> who have large and good Veſſels, they can bring about twenty of theſe into ſervice: and this is all the ſtrength they can make at Sea, which is not very conſiderable, if the power of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> would joyn together to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack them: And indeed, it is by Sea, that they may with moſt eaſe and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty be deſtroyed, and not by Land, where they march with millions of men into the field: it being moſt true, that the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> can make up two or three Armies, that ſhall each conſiſt of at leaſt two hundred and fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, as well foot as horſe, but much ſtronger in horſe than foot. Did they underſtand the art of War ſo well as we do, they would be invincible, ſince they have ſo much ſtrength and courage. They carry along with their Armies a great number of ſmall braſs Field-pieces, which require not above
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:152568:19"/> two horſes to draw each of them; of theſe they have many, and ſo ſoon as they encamp they chain them to one another, and make a large ring, wherein they place a part of their Infantry, and there ſecure the Tents of their Chiefs.</p>
            <p>That which makes them ſo valiant is their opinion and belief of <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> and their holding that all thoſe that die in battel for the defence of their <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Countrey</hi> die <hi>Martyrs</hi> and go into <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe,</hi> without any obligation of giving farther account or ſatisfaction for their former tranſgreſſions: on the contrary, ſuch as die with their backs towards the enemy, flying from the ſhock, are all damned, and if they do eſcape the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they loſe their honour and the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi>'s pay, and oftentimes their <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders</hi> put them to death, at leaſt their goods and eſtates are ſure to be confiſcate. They are ill armed, the foot who are quite naked carrying only a ſmall Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, and a very ſhort Sword, which the greater part ſeldom know how to uſe, ſo that although they are very nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, if they be roundly charged, they are eaſily overcome, whatever reſiſtance they ſtrive to make. Their Cavalry are better, being advantageouſly mounted
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:152568:20"/> upon very good horſes; they go on to fight with much heat and fury, but will not ſtand any long engagement, unleſs they gain ſome apparent advantage; and if they make a retreat, it is by turning now and then back, and making a ſlight charge at every facing upon the enemy, which is their way.</p>
            <p>And although I have in this Diſcourſe made known the power of this great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, yet I dare warrant, would <hi>God</hi> permit an <hi>union</hi> of the forces belonging to the <hi>Chriſtian Princes</hi> and <hi>Potentates,</hi> that they would be more than ſufficient to deſtroy them in a few years. But, as I have already hinted, they muſt firſt be attacked by Sea, and the Land forces ought by all means to avoid giving battel till they have the news of a naval victory, which will be inevitable, if <hi>God</hi> for our ſins ſhould not hinder and obſtruct the effect of our joynt endeavours.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Catholick King</hi> might arm an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Galleys,</hi> as well ſuch as he keeps upon the coaſt of <hi>Spain,</hi> as thoſe of the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicilia,</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending that Squadron he maintains at <hi>Genoa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Republick</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> (aſſiſted by <hi>France</hi> with Men and Proviſions) might
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:152568:20"/> very well furniſh two hundred <hi>Galleys</hi> with all the equipage neceſſary for their navigation; they may likewiſe furniſh ſix <hi>Galeaſſes,</hi> which may well be called <hi>Mountains</hi> of the Sea, for they are won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull great Veſſels, and yet are rowed like <hi>Galleys,</hi> and carry a great number of <hi>Guns,</hi> ſome of them fit for battery. It is obſerved, that when the battel of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panto</hi> was fought againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> the <hi>Galeaſſes</hi> belonging to the <hi>Republick</hi> of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> which were there, and had their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my on board them, procured that Victory.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe numbers of <hi>Galleys,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> can ſend eight or ten; <hi>France</hi> hath commonly twelve or fifteen, and could upon ſuch an occaſion ſet out fifty at leaſt, if not more; <hi>Savoy</hi> five or ſix; <hi>Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cany</hi> ten or a dozen; <hi>Genoa</hi> eight or ten; and <hi>Malta</hi> ſix. All theſe together would make up three hundred and fourſcore <hi>Galleys,</hi> and ſix <hi>Galeaſſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would afterwards joyn to this force, which is very great, and might eaſily maſter and command the whole <hi>Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean-Sea,</hi> a hundred or two hundred of the largeſt and ſtouteſt Ships that ſail upon the Ocean. The <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> the moſt powerfull of any at Sea, might if he pleaſed, wonderfully help towards
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:152568:21"/> this enterprize; the <hi>Lords</hi> of the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> might give a great addition, being ſo renowned through all the world; the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi> in his Countries and coaſt of <hi>Bretagne, Guienne, Normandy</hi> and <hi>Provence</hi> might forward this deſign, there being no <hi>Prince</hi> in all <hi>Europe</hi> that hath more <hi>Pilots</hi> and <hi>Mariners</hi> than his <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,</hi> who alone is able to furniſh more Seamen than any of the <hi>Princes</hi> in <hi>Europe;</hi> their number is ſo great, that for want of employment in their own Countrey, they go abroad and ſerve in foreign <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys</hi> and Ships of <hi>War:</hi> ſo that his <hi>Majeſty</hi> may greatly contribute to this pious War. The <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> has likewiſe ſome very good and brave men of War; each of theſe great <hi>Monarchs</hi> ſetting a helping hand to this work, they are able together to put out a Fleet of above two hundred ſtout <hi>Ships,</hi> and <hi>Gallions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Fleet</hi> would be much more uſefull and conſiderable than that of the <hi>Galleys,</hi> and ſerve to many more purpoſes, that is, to fight, to carry recruits, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever refreſhments ſhall be neceſſary where they are wanting, either to the <hi>Galleys</hi> or elſewhere: they might alſo have great numbers of Souldiers that might be landed on the enemies Countrey in convenient
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:152568:21"/> places, and alſo trains of Artillery where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to beſiege Forts and Caſtles that ought to be attacked: they can carry Arms to furniſh ſuch poor <hi>Chriſtians</hi> (ſlaves to the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi>) who would be willing to revolt in favour of our Army.</p>
            <p>If this Union and force at Sea thus projected could be brought to paſs, it could never be deſtroy'd but by the anger of the divine power in ſome moſt prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſtorms at Sea. There ought to be a place appointed where all the <hi>Galleys</hi> and <hi>Ships</hi> might have their general ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous to meet in a Body. At <hi>Malta</hi> there are very capacious and ſafe Harbors, but that is a barren <hi>Iſland,</hi> where they have not Corn enough to feed their <hi>Knights</hi> and their own Inhabitants, their proviſions being brought thither from <hi>Sicilia.</hi>

            <p>There muſt, at the ſame time, be a powerfull Land Army likewiſe, which ſhould march by <hi>Bulgaria,</hi> and go on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Adrianople;</hi> and as I have ſaid, all the common people of <hi>Greece,</hi> who inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit that Countrey, being <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and there being very few <hi>Turks</hi> amongſt them, they would moſt willingly riſe: As to the number that Army ſhould conſiſt of, that of the <hi>Turks</hi> upon ſuch an occaſion would be very numerous and ſtrong, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ours ought in ſome meaſure, if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,

               <p>Let us then ſpeak of the War that is now in <hi>Hungary:</hi> And foraſmuch as a diſcourſe you made to me about three years ſince, brought us within ſight of a black cloud that was gathering in <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilvania,</hi> and which hath ſince produced ſuch a tempeſt, as hath born down <hi>George Ragotsky</hi> and <hi>Jona Kemin,</hi> to raiſe <hi>Abafti</hi> to the Throne: entertain me with the cauſe and ſequel of that change, that I may the better know whence it happened that the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> who had been only an idle Spectator in the Tragedy, (which <hi>Europe</hi> was acting for thirty years together) ſhould now attack his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours without provocation, and give us occaſion to take up Arms, while we are in a capacity to unite in ſuch a manner as may give him cauſe to repent his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking. I am confident that this rupture was preceded, accompanied and followed with ſo many notable circumſtances, that I might to good uſe and purpoſe, ſpend many days in canvaſing and weighing them; and ſuch as ſhall conſider them duly afterwards may reap both pleaſure and profit by it.</p>

               <p>Although your will hath ever been a law to me, yet is it not without ſome kind of regret that I now undertake to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:152568:30"/> ſatisfie you in this point, as being afraid to ſpeak more than I ſhould: but ſince you muſt needs know whence they fetch thoſe remedies they will, or do intend to, apply, I ſhall do my beſt endeavour to ſatisfie and entertain you on that ſubject. And that you may have the more reaſon to acquieſce in what I ſhall tell you, I will take my riſe from the very firſt ſource, and repreſent in Epitome, all what the <hi>Turks</hi> have done in <hi>Hungary</hi> ſince the time that <hi>Bajazet</hi> came thither to ſupport their rebellion, and foment their diſcord. I know the ignorant will ſay, that the <hi>Turk</hi> hath little or no regard to juſtice when he undertakes a War; and that the advantage he thinks to meet with in his enterprizes is ever the principal motive of his deſigns. For my own part, I own there is little faith to be hoped for or expected from an Infidel, and that many times the <hi>Turk</hi> hath no other aim in his attempts but his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt: But withall it is not impoſſible for him to cloak thoſe deſigns his ambition prompts him to act in the world, with ſome fair and ſpecious pretence. And for this reaſon I will let you plainly ſee, why the <hi>Ottomans</hi> think and believe they have juſt cauſe to preſerve <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:152568:31"/> and by the ſame means you will come to underſtand and know the ground we have to defend it againſt him, and how it comes to paſs we are obliged to raiſe great forces, and to demand the aſſiſtance of ſtrangers. After this I ſhall proceed to the reſolutions were taken at <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> and ſatisfie ſuch as would know in what manner our <hi>Princes</hi> do contribute towards the preſervation of <hi>Germany,</hi> and to the War we have undertaken for our own defence.</p>

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:152568:31"/> protect them. Begin therefore, if you pleaſe, and relate it all as diſtinctly and briefly as you poſſibly can.</p>

               <p>And yet it proved unfortunate; and to the ruine of <hi>Hungary;</hi> which hapned thus. <hi>Amurath</hi> II. of that Name, the <hi>Turkiſh Sultan,</hi> finding <hi>Europe</hi> combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt him, and fearing the Forces of <hi>Aſia,</hi> conſulted his own prudence, and with admirable Craft and Wiſedom, obtained that Peace of <hi>Uladiſlaus</hi> he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely deſired. He ſent <hi>Ambaſſadors</hi> under pretence of treating concerning the liberty of <hi>Carambo;</hi> but in effect it was to diſperſe that ſtorm that threatned him. Theſe <hi>Agents</hi> well knowing what influence the <hi>Deſpote</hi> had in the <hi>King's Counſel,</hi> and in the heart of <hi>John Hunia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des Corvinus,</hi> believed that if they could but gain him, they ſhould gain all their ends. They planted therefore two Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries againſt him, which nothing can reſiſt, I mean <hi>Affection</hi> and <hi>Intereſt.</hi> They offer'd the reſtitution of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and his Eſtate, if he could but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

This propoſition pleaſing the <hi>Deſpote,</hi> he ſoon brought <hi>Huniades Corvinus</hi> to approve of it; and theſe two being thus agreed, they found no great difficulty in perſuading the <hi>King</hi> to an accommodation. The <hi>Peace</hi> was made, the <hi>Turk</hi> withdrew all the Garriſons he had in <hi>Myſia,</hi> reſtored them effectually, and exactly performed all he had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. But whilſt the parties were thu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> employ'd in the executing of this <hi>Teeaty;</hi> Letters arrived from <hi>Greece,</hi> which aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them that thoſe People, who knew nothing of the concluſion of this <hi>Peace,</hi> expected every moment when the game would be begun; for that they were fully reſolved not to ſtand with Armes accroſs like idle Spectators, the abſence of the <hi>Sultan</hi> who was in <hi>Aſia,</hi> giving them a very favourable opportunity to puſh on their deſigns. The <hi>Italian Fleet,</hi> which advanced towards the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> deſired the ſame thing with great eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Theſe Letters having been read in the <hi>Senate,</hi> even thoſe that had been moſt forward and zealous for the <hi>Peace,</hi> were now ſorry it was concluded: But none durſt mention the breaking of an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which had been confirmed by a
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:152568:37"/> ſolemn Oath. Then <hi>Julian,</hi> the <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Legate,</hi> powerfull in perſuaſion, of great credit and eloquence, prompted by an indiſcreet Zeal, and an impious piety, undertook by a diſcourſe as lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as it was vehement, to prove that they ought to break that <hi>Treaty</hi> made with an <hi>Infidel.</hi> 
                  <q>He chid the ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, encouraged the timorous, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted the afflicted, and wholly encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned both the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Grandees</hi> of <hi>Hungary</hi> to a rupture. He ſaid, he well foreſaw the diſadvantages of that Peace; but had not oppoſed it, leſt he ſhould have ſeemed to accuſe <hi>Huni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades</hi> of imprudence, and have appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red cruel towards the <hi>Deſpote</hi> of <hi>Myſia,</hi> who could not have redeemed his Children from the Tyranny of the <hi>Turk,</hi> but by the ſaid Peace. He aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them they might ſafely do it, ſince they might juſtly and reaſonably break their Faith with the <hi>Turk,</hi> who by his fineſs and craft had broken the bonds of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> alliance: He repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted how that, indeed, the <hi>Hungarians</hi> could not grant a Peace to the <hi>Sultan,</hi> without firſt having the conſent of their Brethren: and that an Oath unjuſtly made, could not oblige without inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:152568:38"/> He endeavour'd to make out that the Oath, they had made to <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath,</hi> was null; that it did not bind their <hi>Conſciences;</hi> and that they might rely upon him in this particular as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt knowing in Affairs of that Nature; and concluded that they ought to aſſemble their Forces, march towards <hi>Thrace,</hi> and joyn with the other <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> before the over-ſight they had committed ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed farther into <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </q> Theſe and the like arguments and reaſons, uttered with Authority, and by a moſt eloquent tongue, inſpired the <hi>Hungarians</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare unanimouſly, that they would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loſe their lives, than forſake their Brethren at this juncture. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, the Army was drawn forth, and <hi>John Huniades,</hi> marching in the Van, the <hi>King</hi> followed with the reſt of the Army. This <hi>Prince</hi> being on his way, <hi>Dracula</hi> the <hi>Vaivode</hi> of <hi>Valachia</hi> went to wait upon him, and told him, he admired at the boldneſs of his attempt, in going to attack the <hi>Turk</hi> with ſo inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable an Army; that his Enemy went a-hunting with as many men as he had then about him; that he adviſed him to return again. This Counſel was rejected,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:152568:38"/> and the <hi>Vaivode</hi> having left four thouſand Horſe with the <hi>King</hi> under the Conduct of his own Son, he retired. <hi>Amurath</hi> being informed that <hi>Hungary</hi> was arming againſt him, quitted <hi>Aſia,</hi> and returned into <hi>Europe,</hi> got his Forces a-foot, and the ſooneſt he could poſſibly, attacked <hi>Uladiſlaus</hi> at <hi>Varnes,</hi> a City of <hi>Bulgaria,</hi> and defeated him intirely. The event of which Battel, ſo fatal to the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and fortunate to thoſe <hi>Infidels,</hi> made it apparent by the Death of the King of <hi>Hungary, Julian</hi> the Pope's Legate, and an infinite number of brave men beſides, that we ought to keep our promiſed Faith; and that God will puniſh the perfidious, let them cloak the Crime with what pretence ſoever they pleaſe. It's ſaid that <hi>Amurath,</hi> obſerving his men had the worſt at the beginning of the Fight, drew out of his Boſom the <hi>Treaty</hi> that had been ſigned between him and the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> and lifting his Eyes to <hi>Heaven,</hi> ſaid more than once with great earneſtneſs and affection, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, behold the Agreement here the Chriſtians had made with me; to which they have ſworn by thy Divinity, and which they now break in Deriſion of thee: Now, if thou, O Chriſt, art God, as they do ſay, revenge I
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:152568:39"/> beſeech thee, an injury done to thy ſelf, and to me; and let even thoſe that do not yet truly know thy Name be witneſs, that thou canst puniſh ſuch as violate the ſanctity of thoſe promiſes which they had ſealed with thy ſacred Name.</hi> Which Prayer was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, or anſwered, with the total de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat of the Chriſtians. The King's head was fixed upon the point of a Lance, and carried into many parts of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> as a token of an entire Victory. The Body of the <hi>Cardinal Julian,</hi> who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded them to this breach of Faith, was found naked and pierced with many Wounds. The Epitaph of this King who proved both valiant and happy, ſo long as he was carefull to make good his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, is worthy of your notice. Thus it is,

                  <hi>God</hi> intending to puniſh this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy <hi>Kingdom,</hi> yet not wholly deſtroy it, reſerved <hi>John Huniades,</hi> who finding things were in a moſt deſperate condition after the death of the King, ſaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by flight. The following year, the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> who till then had rejected <hi>Ladiſlaus,</hi> the poſthumus Son of the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour Albertus</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> did unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly acknowledge him their King, being but five years old. And foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he could not ſway the <hi>Sceptre,</hi> becauſe of his Childhood, they gave the management of all Affairs to <hi>John Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niades Corvinus,</hi> who two years after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards augmented the Triumphs of <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath,</hi> by the loſs of two and twenty thouſand men, that were ſent to oppoſe him. Some time after <hi>Amurath</hi> the <hi>Turk</hi> died at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> and for Succeſſour left <hi>Mahomet</hi> II. his Son, who ſurpaſſed all his Anceſtours in Greatneſs of Courage, and Subtilty of Mind.

This loſs abated the Courage of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> raiſed that of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and gave him hopes of adding <hi>Hungary</hi> to the acquiſition he had made of <hi>Greece.</hi> To this purpoſe he ravaged <hi>Myſia,</hi> and with two hundred and fifty thouſand Men beſieged the City of <hi>Belgrade;</hi> called by the Ancients <hi>Alba Greca:</hi> but the place being well defended by <hi>Huni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades,</hi> he loſt almoſt all his Army, and an hundred great pieces of Cannon: <hi>Huni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades</hi> did not long ſurvive this brave Action, for he died the 8th. of <hi>September,</hi> 1456. And the <hi>Turk</hi> turning his thoughts towards <hi>Perſia,</hi> and againſt <hi>Italy,</hi> left <hi>Hungary</hi> in quiet: hoping the ambition of the <hi>Grandees,</hi> and the Youth of the <hi>King</hi> would create ſome troubles, during the peace, and that thoſe troubles would give him an opportunity to ſubject that <hi>Kingdom</hi> by pretending to ſpare it.</p>

He tells us in his fifth <hi>Century</hi> of his <hi>Hungarian Monarchy,</hi> that the <hi>Emperour</hi> made a ſeizure of the moneys which the Nobility and Clergy had raiſed to ſupply <hi>Mathias</hi> in the War he had undertaken againſt the <hi>Turk,</hi> and that the Pope helped to drain his Countrey of Treaſure, ordering Collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be there made for the <hi>Knights of Rhodes.</hi> All this did not hinder <hi>Stephen Battory,</hi> and <hi>Paul Caniſius,</hi> fighting under his auſpicious Banner, from defeating <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libek,</hi> leaving threeſcore thouſand of his men dead upon the ſpot.

Notwithſtanding he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to make a <hi>Truce</hi> with <hi>Mahomet;</hi> and that <hi>Tyrant</hi> being dead, <hi>Anno</hi> 1481. he did his utmoſt to renew the War to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. To which purpoſe he deſired
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:152568:42"/> paſs-ports for ſome <hi>Ambaſſadors</hi> he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſend to him, but could not obtain any. He alſo entreated the <hi>Pope</hi> to let him have <hi>Zemini,</hi> the Son of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> that he might make uſe of him againſt his Brother <hi>Bajazet,</hi> who was newly ſeated in the <hi>Turkiſh Throne,</hi> and he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it. This refuſal was the more ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as being onely upon the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a little Summ of money he muſt have loſt, which <hi>Bajazet</hi> had promiſed to pay him annually; whilſt he obliged himſelf to confirm the ſame <hi>Truce</hi> with <hi>Bajazet,</hi> as had been made with <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> his Father.

                  <hi>Uladiſlaus</hi> aſcended the <hi>Throne.</hi> The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this <hi>Reign</hi> was troubleſome: <hi>Albert</hi> the Brother of <hi>Uladiſlaus,</hi> aſſiſted by the Brothers of <hi>Caſimir King</hi> of <hi>Poland,</hi> their <hi>Father,</hi> beſieged <hi>Caſſovia,</hi> the <hi>Capital</hi> of the upper <hi>Hungary,</hi> and gave him much perplexity on that ſide. <hi>Blaiſius Magger,</hi> Servant to <hi>John Corvinus,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry his Maſter had been rejected, refuſed to give the <hi>Crown</hi> to the New <hi>King,</hi> which he had in keeping at <hi>Vice-grade,</hi> endured a Siege, and did not ſurrender it, till commanded ſo to do by <hi>Corvinus.

In fine; <hi>Uladiſlaus,</hi> growing weary of ſo many diſturbances, came to an agreement with <hi>Maximilian,</hi> the Articles whereof were ſo odious to the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> that <hi>Emeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Prini, Palatin</hi> of <hi>Hungary,</hi> cauſed it to be proclaimed thorough all the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs</hi> of the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Presburg,</hi> that he did not conſent to them, nor ever would give his conſent thereto.

That divers people, and the beſt governed in <hi>Europe,</hi> exclude the <hi>Women</hi> from the <hi>Crown,</hi> for fear leſt it ſhould paſs into the hands of Strangers. That the <hi>Hungarian Nobility</hi> were not ſo degenerated, but that they might find ſome heads amongſt them worthy to wear a <hi>Crown;</hi> and although he were none of the moſt deſerving, yet he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed himſelf was not incapable either to <hi>Govern</hi> a great <hi>Kingdom,</hi> or to defend this with his <hi>Sword.</hi>

And becauſe it was not impoſſible but <hi>John</hi> might leave ſome Children, it was ſaid, that if he had a <hi>Son,</hi> that <hi>Son</hi> ſhould poſſeſs all the <hi>Lands, Cities</hi> and <hi>Caſtles,</hi> that belonged to <hi>John,</hi> before he was <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Hungary.</hi> And moreover, beſides the things above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, he ſhould be <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Tranſilvania.</hi>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:152568:51"/> This <hi>Treaty</hi> was ill obſerved. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> cauſed <hi>Tranſilvania</hi> to be attaqued by <hi>Balthaſar Banfy; Sclavonia,</hi> by <hi>John Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eranerus,</hi> and the Province of <hi>Sebuſa,</hi> by <hi>Leonard Baron of Veltz.</hi> All theſe attempts proved vain, by the prudence of <hi>King John,</hi> and the valour of the <hi>Monk George Martinuſias</hi> his Favorite. And for this cauſe, they came to another agreement. The <hi>Calm</hi> which this King enjoy'd after that <hi>Tempeſt</hi> was blown over, gave him leaſure to think of his marriage.

               <p>In this affair, <hi>King John</hi> was like unto him that holds a <hi>Wolf</hi> by the <hi>Ears:</hi> He found there was as much cauſe of fear on the behalf of <hi>Solyman,</hi> as from his competitor to the <hi>Kingdom;</hi> and he thought he might have better hopes in a <hi>Chriſtian Prince,</hi> than from an Infidel. Yet ſo it fell out, that in the end, his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors ſubmitted to the <hi>Turk,</hi> to preſerve part of their Dignity: as we are going to ſee. Some while after the Marriage of <hi>King John, Stephen Maillats,</hi> and ſome others, took up Arms againſt him, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of <hi>Ferdinand.</hi> Then <hi>John</hi> willing to extinguiſh the Fire, before it grew to a greater head, left the <hi>Queen</hi> at <hi>Buda,</hi> and went into <hi>Tranſilvania;</hi> where he freely pardon'd thoſe that confeſſed and were ſorry for their faults; which <hi>Clemency</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed many to return to their Duty. But <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats</hi> retired to the ſtrong <hi>Caſtle</hi> of <hi>Pogaras,</hi> to wait for the aſſiſtance that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was ſending to him, under the conduct of <hi>Nadaſdy.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> beſieged him there, and took it after a long Siege. In the mean time a Couriere comes, who brings him News of the Birth of a <hi>Son,</hi> whom God had ſent him. Such News being very pleaſing to thoſe that have no Children, and eſpecially to people advanced in
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:152568:52"/> years, we may imagine that <hi>King John</hi> received it with great joy. This invited him to drink to ſome exceſs, after the <hi>Hungarian</hi> faſhion. And that exceſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing ſome diſtemper he had, he died at <hi>Saſſebes,</hi> a few days after the Birth of his <hi>Son,</hi> in the 53. year of his Age. His death was concealed, as much as it was poſſible; but at length it was made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick with the tenor of his <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> By it, the <hi>King</hi> declared his Son the univerſal Heir of all his Eſtate: and <hi>George Martiniſius Tutor</hi> to the ſaid <hi>Prince.</hi> Some days before he died, the <hi>King</hi> had exhorted the <hi>Hungarian Nobility</hi> to have a regard to the honour of the <hi>Nation,</hi> and to prefer his Son before any other when they came to elect a <hi>King:</hi> aſſuring them that the <hi>Turk</hi> would take care to protect him, if they had recourſe to his Arms. The prayers and requeſt of a dying <hi>King,</hi> and the fear and averſion the <hi>Hungarians</hi> had of ſubmitting to a ſtranger, obliged ſome to ſet the <hi>Crown</hi> upon the <hi>Infants</hi> Head on the day he was Baptized, and to ſend to the <hi>Port,</hi> to demand aſſiſtance of <hi>Solyman.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Kingdom of Hungary</hi> is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, yet hath ſuffer'd no more than it have deſerved. It is a moſt ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

King <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> being informed of the death
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:152568:53"/> of his adverſary, ſent <hi>Nicholas Count of Salmes</hi> to the <hi>Widow,</hi> to deſire ſhe would make good the treaty agreed upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt her Husband, and him: to ſubmit to that by reaſon, which otherwiſe ſhe would be compell'd to doe by force: that ſhe and her Son, would find more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in acquieſcing to what had been promiſed by the late <hi>King,</hi> with mature deliberation, than by drawing the miſeries of an obſtinate and bloody War upon the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Hungary.</hi> That he was ready to make good his engagements, and uſe her with a more than ordinary clemency and kindneſs. The <hi>Queen</hi> anſwer'd the <hi>Count,</hi> that her <hi>Sex,</hi> her <hi>Age,</hi> and her <hi>Grief,</hi> rendred her uncapable of reſolving on an affair of ſo great importance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking the advice of her <hi>Father</hi> the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Poland;</hi> that ſhe deſired that <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> would allow her ſome months for theſe reaſons; that the <hi>Emperour Charles,</hi> or himſelf could not in honour attaque a <hi>Woman</hi> drowned in <hi>Tears,</hi> and an Infant rocked in his <hi>Cradle.</hi> This anſwer diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who ſent <hi>Leonard Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron of Velts</hi> with an Army, to compell her to obey. The <hi>Queen</hi> finding her ſelf in this extremity, diſpatched ſome Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to the <hi>Port.</hi> Theſe were very well
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:152568:54"/> received by <hi>Solyman,</hi> and brought thence a Scarlet <hi>Robe</hi> embroidered; an iron <hi>Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> with a handle and pomel of Gold, and a <hi>Cymiter,</hi> whoſe Scabberd was ſet with precious Stones, as tokens of his amity, and protection. At the ſame time, the <hi>Sultan</hi> commanded the <hi>Governours</hi> of all the neighbouring places to take the Field without delay to aſſiſt that <hi>Queen. Laſcus,</hi> who was gone over to ſerve <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and who at that inſtant was his <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> demanded the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Hungary</hi> of the <hi>Turk,</hi> upon the conditions he had formerly given it to <hi>John Zapoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ha.</hi> This demand diſtaſted the <hi>Tyrant,</hi> who put the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> into Priſon; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he deſerved to die, for daring to ſcoff and affront his <hi>Highneſs</hi> in that manner. <hi>Solyman</hi> therefore denying <hi>Ferdinand's</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and ſending ſuccours to <hi>Queen Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth, Hungary</hi> became the <hi>Theatre</hi> of many and moſt horrible confuſions.

At the ſame time, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties had order to tell her, that if he did not viſit her, it was for fear leſt it might ſtain her Reputation. The <hi>Queen</hi> thanked the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> for his civility and care, and doubting whether ſhe were beſt to ſend her Son, or not ſend him, <hi>George Martiniſius</hi> told her, ſhe could not refuſe it. Over-come therefore by neceſſity, ſhe laid him in a <hi>Cradle</hi> worthy of ſuch a <hi>Child;</hi> and having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the <hi>Nurſe,</hi> and ſome other <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons,</hi> together with divers <hi>Hungarian Lords</hi> to attend <hi>him,</hi> ſhe ſent him to the <hi>Camp; Solyman</hi> to ſhew the greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and honour, cauſed them to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by a party of <hi>Horſe,</hi> ſaw the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant,</hi> and cauſed it to be careſſed by his <hi>Children.</hi> And at the ſame time, ſeized upon one of the <hi>Gates</hi> of <hi>Buda,</hi> whence his Troops got into all the ſtreets and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

This <hi>Lord</hi> ſuffer'd himſelf eaſily to be engaged in this noble deſign, becauſe he had courage, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he thought it ſcandalous in a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> to favour thoſe that aimed only at the utter deſtruction of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> He made an agreement, therefore with the <hi>Emperour,</hi> the chief <hi>Articles</hi> whereof were; <hi>That</hi> Sigiſmund <hi>taking up Arms againſt the</hi> Turk, <hi>the Emperour ſhould be obliged not to make any peace, but by the joynt conſent of the</hi> Tranſilvanian; <hi>and if it came to that, the Principalities of</hi> Vala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia, Moldavia <hi>and</hi> Tranſilvania, <hi>ſhould be comprehended; that he ſhould enjoy the title, the honour and the prerogative of a Prince of the Empire; that they ſhould aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign him an honourable rank amongſt them;
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:152568:64"/> that the Emperour ſhould beſtow a Princeſs of the Houſe and Blood of</hi> Auſtria <hi>upon him; ſo long as the preſent War ſhould laſt, he ſhould annually furniſh him with an hundred thouſand</hi> Florins <hi>of the Rhine, which are worth four hundred thouſand</hi> French <hi>Livers, and ſhould maintain a good body of</hi> German <hi>Horſe and Foot for him; that all ſuch places as he could gain by the Sword ſhould remain in propriety to him and his Heirs of both Sexes: That if by misfortune the</hi> Turk <hi>ſhould happen to drive him out of</hi> Tranſilvania, <hi>The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour ſhould give him Lands in the Empire, ſufficient to maintain him like a Prince; That there ſhould be a general Amneſty for himſelf, and for all thoſe that had ſerved him in favour of the</hi> Turk <hi>againſt his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Majeſty; That he ſhould re-enter upon all thoſe Lands he had before in</hi> Illyria <hi>and in</hi> Hungary; <hi>that the Emperour ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide him with Artillery, Powder and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitions for War: And that on his part, he ſhould take the field with fourſcore thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Combatants,</hi> Tranſilvanians, Vala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chians <hi>and</hi> Moldavians. This agreement was ſealed, by the Marriage of <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> with <hi>Maria Chriſtina,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Charles Archduke</hi> of <hi>Gretz;</hi> by the <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Golden Fleece,</hi> ſent him from <hi>Philip</hi> II. <hi>King of Spain;</hi> by the <hi>conſecrated Hat</hi>

Then the <hi>Tranſilvanian</hi> took near his perſon the <hi>Siculae,</hi> who were very affectionate towards him; and ſtudying a moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible revenge againſt his <hi>Kindred,</hi> and the <hi>Grandees</hi> of <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> convocated the <hi>Eſtates</hi> at <hi>Claudiopolis.</hi> There it was that <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> put to death <hi>Balthaſar Battory</hi> his Uncle, and divers other Lords of the Country, whom he declared guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Treaſon, and amongſt the reſt, <hi>Stephen</hi> and <hi>Andreas Battory,</hi> his Couſins, the <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>Balthaſar.</hi> At the ſame time <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> believing he had ſuppreſs'd and ſtifled the rebellion, cauſed his League with the <hi>Emperour,</hi> againſt the <hi>Ottomans</hi> to be proclaimed thorough all his Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories; and exhorted his Subjects to take up Arms to free themſelves from the tyranny they had ſo long endured. In few days afterwards, he had fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:152568:65"/> men on foot, and having put them under good Officers, cauſed them to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance towards the <hi>Danube</hi> to begin the <hi>Dance.</hi> And now, indeed, being in the Field, fortune ſided with him, and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gave him opportunity to take ſeven <hi>Ships,</hi> laden with money, and other rich goods, which <hi>Sinan</hi> would have employ'd for the corrupting of the Officers of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna,</hi> that he might betray it to his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</hi> This prize and victory made <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmund</hi> hope he ſhould be able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege and take <hi>Themiſvar:</hi> but ſcarce had he attack'd it, when news came the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi> ravaged his Countrey; ſo that he was forced to go back and defend it: The <hi>Siege</hi> being raiſed, he marches towards thoſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and finding them in a place that was inacceſſible, where valour would have proved but uſeleſs, he betook himſelf to craft; and having ſet fire to their quarters, he forced them to come out, and utterly defeated them without much trouble or loſs.</p>

               <p>I am fair and ſoftly drawing on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards what you deſire to know. The <hi>Valachians</hi> and <hi>Moldavians</hi> admiring the <hi>Victories</hi> of the <hi>Tranſilvanians,</hi> would needs have their ſhare, and therefore joyned with them. <hi>Sultan Amurath,</hi> finding his loſſes cauſed this revolt, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to prevent the like; and to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, commanded the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Themiſvar,</hi> to attack thoſe Rebels, and to make them feel the ſeverity of fire and ſword. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> willing to obey this order, went into the field: but was defeated about the latter end of the year 1564. This <hi>Victory</hi> of <hi>Sigiſmund</hi>'s, was ſoon follow'd by another over above twenty thouſand <hi>Tartars,</hi> who returning homewards, laden with booty, were ſet upon, and defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the ſaid <hi>Sigiſmund:</hi> About the ſame time died <hi>Amurath</hi> II. and had for Succeſſour <hi>Mahomet</hi> the third his Son, who was then aged about thirty years. <hi>Mahomet</hi> being come to the <hi>Crown,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed great largeſſes upon his <hi>Janizaries,</hi> and made great preparations for a War againſt the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> Having therefore
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:152568:66"/> had information, that the <hi>Coſacks,</hi> and the <hi>Podolians</hi> were entred into the <hi>League</hi> with the <hi>Tranſilvanians,</hi> he ſent an Army of an hundred thouſand men, under the conduct of <hi>Sinan,</hi> whom he commanded to chaſtize theſe rebels exemplarily. <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan</hi> prepared himſelf to execute the commands he had from his <hi>Maſter;</hi> and whilſt he was endeavouring to gain ſome Friends in <hi>Moldavia,</hi> he likewiſe raiſed a formidable Army to compleat his deſign. For all this, he was but roughly handled by <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> who follow'd him ſo cloſe at his heels, when he thought to repaſs the <hi>Danube,</hi> that the Bridge being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with the numerous Crowds of ſuch as fled, broke down; and <hi>Sinan</hi> fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into the River, was in great danger of keeping company with an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his Men, who were then drowned. This action, added to divers others, wherein the good fortune, prudence, and valour of <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> had been manifeſted with great ſplendour, gained him the name of <hi>Invincible,</hi> and forced <hi>Mahomet</hi> to take the conduct of the Army upon himſelf. Now does he take the field with two hundred thouſand fighting men; and theſe dreadfull forces gave him the confidence to advance as far as <hi>Agria.</hi>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:152568:66"/> There it was that the <hi>Arch-Duke Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian,</hi> and <hi>Prince Sigiſmund</hi> deſpiſing his great numbers, out of a cuſtome of bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them, gave him a Battel, which might have reſtored the whole affairs of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> had not the infamous, and inſatiable deſire of <hi>booty,</hi> put a ſtop to their farther victory and purſute. Ours loſt about twenty thouſand men, and the <hi>Turks</hi> many more. But, from that time, it ſeemed, <hi>Fortune</hi> who till then had been favourable to the <hi>Tranſilvanian,</hi> now tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her back. That <hi>Prince</hi> forgetting his former <hi>Valour,</hi> reſolved to exchange <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilvania</hi> for ſome Lands in <hi>Sileſia:</hi> and to attain thoſe ends, he raiſed all the force he could, to make his utmoſt effort. He beſieged <hi>Themiſvar,</hi> and was conſtrain'd to raiſe the ſame, as at the firſt time. Some while after, the <hi>Baſſa Ibrahim</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged <hi>Varadin:</hi> And <hi>Baſta</hi> having intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted our <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> to joyn his forces with thoſe he commanded, to relieve the place, he promis'd it, but broke his word. Since that time, nothing appeared in him but irreſolution, and inconſtancy. He cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his <hi>Couſin,</hi> the <hi>Cardinal Battory,</hi> to be proclaimed <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Tranſilvania:</hi> and not being able to maintain it; he reſigned his <hi>Eſtate</hi> to the Emperour <hi>Rodolphus</hi> II.

               <p>I told you before, that <hi>Sigiſmund Battory, Prince</hi> of <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> had marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Maria Chriſtina</hi> of <hi>Auſtria:</hi> But being as ſluggiſh in the <hi>War</hi> of <hi>Venus,</hi> as he was brave and active in the field of <hi>Mars,</hi> he owned his impotence; and his marriage was declared <hi>Null.</hi> But I have not yet told you, that after ſeveral miſchiefs which his departure brought upon the <hi>Eſtates</hi> of <hi>Tranſilvania, Moldavia</hi> and <hi>Valachia,</hi> which he had yielded up to the <hi>Emperour;</hi> and after he had repented it, and ſhewed many tokens of an extreme inconſtancy, he died at <hi>Prague</hi> the 17th. of <hi>March</hi> 1603. This death did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the poſſeſſion of <hi>Tranſilvania</hi> to the <hi>Emperour:</hi> For the <hi>Turk,</hi> having ſtill ſome partiſans in the Country, and the people believing their liberty infringed by the agreement made between the Emperour, and the <hi>Tranſilvanian,</hi> no body was ſatisfied with the preſent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:152568:67"/> of things. <hi>George Baſta</hi> the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour's Lieutenant General</hi> in <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> tyrannized over the people. The <hi>Turks,</hi> the <hi>Tartars,</hi> the <hi>Polanders,</hi> and others their neighbours had made it the <hi>Theatre</hi> of a long and bloody Tragedy: inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the <hi>Tranſilvanians</hi> breathed after nothing but their former condition. In effect, <hi>Stephen Boskay,</hi> having driven away the <hi>Decemviry</hi> the <hi>Emperour</hi> had ſent into that Countrey, eſtabliſhed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the good liking of the people, rather by reaſon of the failures commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the <hi>Generals</hi> for the <hi>Emperour Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolphus,</hi> than by any other intereſt or power he could make uſe of: The <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty</hi> complained of the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> the inſolence of ſtrangers, and the extinction of their privileges and immunities <hi>Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kay</hi> fomented theſe grievances, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving his credit amongſt the people, mightily confirmed himſelf in the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his <hi>Principality.</hi> From thence it was, that <hi>Gabriel Bethlem,</hi> (to whom the <hi>Turk</hi> had given ſome hopes of having <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi>) believing it was not yet a fit time to think of that, ſubmitted wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to <hi>Boskay.</hi> In the mean while, the ſame <hi>Bethlem,</hi> being joyned with <hi>Bechtes Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Themiſvar,</hi> endeavour'd to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:152568:68"/> 
                  <hi>Lippa,</hi> and was ſurprized himſelf: So that he was forced to fly in his Shirt, his fear making him forget and leave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him in his pocket the <hi>Treaty</hi> of his <hi>Conſpiracy.</hi> This writing falling into the hands of the <hi>Count de Beljoyoſo, Governour</hi> of the Countrey, mightily perplexed him, and conſulting how to find out ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, it was judged to be incurable. In ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, <hi>Boskay,</hi> loſt no time, vanquiſh'd <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyoſo,</hi> reduced him to extremity, and ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed upon ſeveral places. Then having the <hi>Grandees,</hi> the Cities, and the people on his ſide, he put himſelf into ſuch a condition, that he could talk magiſterially to them; but <hi>fortune,</hi> who takes delight to make her ſelf admired, turned to <hi>Baſta</hi>'s ſide, who having gained ſome <hi>Victories,</hi> exhorted <hi>Boskay</hi> to quit his <hi>ſword,</hi> and bow down his Neck to the <hi>Imperial Yoke. Boskay</hi> who pretended to the <hi>Principality,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, <hi>That if they did not leave him</hi> Tranſilvania; <hi>if they did not put</hi> Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian <hi>Officers into the</hi> Provinces, <hi>and in the</hi> Cities <hi>to Govern them; if they did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the foreign</hi> Militia <hi>to ſome other places and if they did not allow him the exerciſe of his</hi> Religion, <hi>he would rather chuſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer War, than Peace. Fortune,</hi> which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times favours the bold, took <hi>Boskay</hi>'s
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:152568:68"/> part, and made him triumph over all the difficulties he met with in this War. <hi>Baſta,</hi> who preſſed moſt upon him, ſaw all his Victories turned to an entire and utter diſobedience: His Soldiers mutined, telling him, he paid them only with words. They fell upon him in his own Houſe, and thoſe very men that were appointed to guard nine and twenty Waggons, laden with Silver, with Cloath and other Stores, plundred them, and eſcaped ſome into <hi>Poland,</hi> and others to the Enemies. Thus <hi>Tranſilvania</hi> being deliver'd from <hi>Baſta</hi>'s Army, part of the hundred Cities were taken by <hi>Boskay</hi>'s Friends, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder ſurrendred without the trouble of a Summons. This progreſs of <hi>Boskay</hi>'s, forced the <hi>Emperour</hi> to ſend <hi>Demetrius Nabradi, Biſhop of Veſprin,</hi> and <hi>Sigiſmund Forgas</hi> to treat with him. Theſe deputies ſoon found, that his proſperity had made him inſolent. They received no other Anſwer, but only, <hi>If they came from the</hi> Grandees <hi>of</hi> Hungary, <hi>they were welcome; but if they were ſent by the</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, <hi>they might go back again, he being now at that paſs, that he could not retreat, nor change his condition.</hi> This language made the <hi>Deputies</hi> underſtand, that there was nothing for them to doe there; and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:152568:69"/> that <hi>Tranſilvania</hi> had changed its Maſter. In effect, the States of the <hi>Province,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſembled at <hi>Kerene, Boskay</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in his Uſurpation of that <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality:</hi> Upon condition, he would allow the <hi>Roman Religion,</hi> the <hi>Lutheran</hi> and the <hi>Swiſs</hi> to be practiſed amongſt them. Then <hi>Sigiſmund Ragotsky</hi> obtained the Government of <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> and <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Homonay</hi> was made <hi>General</hi> of the forces of that Countrey. The <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> who had his Eyes open upon all theſe changes, ſent a <hi>Chiaux</hi> to <hi>Boskay,</hi> who on his behalf preſented him a <hi>Mace,</hi> a <hi>Cymitar,</hi> and a <hi>Flag,</hi> to confirm him in the poſſeſſion of his new <hi>Principality.</hi> In acknowledgement of which favour, <hi>Boskay</hi> diſpatched <hi>Stephen Corlat,</hi> and <hi>George Kikedy</hi> to the <hi>Port,</hi> to aſſure the <hi>Turk</hi> of his Fidelity, and to offer him ſome token of his obedience.</p>

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:152568:70"/> expired, they were to ſend ten thouſand ducats yearly to the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> as a token of their <hi>Vaſſalage.</hi> Theſe things paſſing thus in <hi>Europe,</hi> the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s of <hi>Aleppo</hi> and <hi>Caramania</hi> were cutting out work for the <hi>Sultan.</hi> For which reaſon he would needs be excuſed from the obligation of aſſiſting <hi>Boskay;</hi> and permitted him to make an agreement with the <hi>Emperour.</hi> On the other hand, his <hi>Majeſty</hi> being ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with ſo long a <hi>War,</hi> and perſuading himſelf that <hi>Boskay</hi> having no Children, there would quickly be ſome new Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution in that State, he ſoon conſented to whatever was propounded. The chief Articles of this <hi>Peace</hi> were, <hi>That there ſhould be an Amneſty on both ſides; that the</hi> Roman Religion, <hi>the</hi> Ausburgh, <hi>and the</hi> Swiſs <hi>ſhould be tolerated thorow all</hi> Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; <hi>that the</hi> Palatine <hi>ſhould be elected by votes; that the Governments of all places ſhould be given to</hi> Hungarians, <hi>excepting</hi> Comora <hi>and</hi> Javarin, <hi>which might be given to</hi> Germans. <hi>All</hi> Tranſilvania, <hi>with that part of</hi> Hungary <hi>that had belonged to</hi> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmund Battory, <hi>ſhould be reſigned to</hi> Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kay, <hi>and that there ſhould be added to them</hi> Zatmar, Vgoe, Tockai <hi>and</hi> Bereg; <hi>that they ſhould endeavour to make a Peace with the</hi> Turk; <hi>and if they could not obtain it,</hi>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:152568:70"/> Boskay <hi>ſhould joyn his Forces with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour</hi>'s. This <hi>Treaty</hi> was approved and ſworn, by the principal Lords of <hi>Hungary, Bohemia, Auſtria, Sileſia, Moravia</hi> and <hi>Luſatia.</hi> Many of them ſigned it, and there was only <hi>Melchior Cleſel,</hi> then <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi> of <hi>Neuſtadt,</hi> and ſince <hi>Cardinal,</hi> who made ſome difficulty, becauſe, ſaid he, they ought not to aſſiſt <hi>Hereticks:</hi> but at length he conſented. This <hi>Peace</hi> was ſucceeded by a <hi>Truce</hi> of twenty years, which the <hi>Emperour</hi> made with the <hi>Turk. By this agreement, the</hi> Sultan <hi>obliged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to call the</hi> Emperour Father, <hi>and the</hi> Emperour <hi>was to give the</hi> Sultan <hi>the Title of</hi> Son. <hi>They were both to bear the name of Emperour; the Controverſies that might poſſibly ariſe between them, were to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the</hi> Governours <hi>of</hi> Javarin, <hi>and</hi> Buda. <hi>The</hi> Forts <hi>were to remain in the ſame condition they were in at that time, and neither was to erect any new one. The</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>gave the</hi> Turk <hi>two hundred thouſand Crowns for once, and after that, they were every three years to beſtow mutual preſents on each other by their</hi> Ambaſſadors; <hi>that their amity might remain the more firm.</hi> Theſe Tranſactions were made, 1606. and followed with the ſickneſs and death of <hi>Boskay,</hi> who for his Succeſſour in the

               <p>Although it be ſaid, that Crowns are extremely heavy, yet they rarely are refuſed. And if I am not deceived, this moderation of <hi>Ragotsky</hi>'s ſhewed he was the more worthy to <hi>Reign.</hi>

               <p>There is no leſs honour in refuſing a <hi>Crown,</hi> than in ſtriving to deſerve one. And I muſt confeſs, did I not know that he rejected it really out of contempt, I ſhould have believed it had been out of fear. The <hi>Emperour Rodolphus</hi> II. had ſome repugnance, for the <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> he had granted. And the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the <hi>Perſian Ambaſſadors,</hi> together with the Rebellion of <hi>Gambolah,</hi> who had drawn over to his party <hi>Aleppo, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus</hi> and <hi>Tripoly,</hi> fomented his irreſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. This was it that gave occaſion to the <hi>Heyducks</hi> to continue their violences, and the <hi>Archduke Matthias</hi> to take up Arms to repreſs their audacious attempts.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:152568:71"/> That <hi>Prince</hi> having his Sword in hand, purſued his point, and obliged the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour Rodolphus</hi> his Brother, to give him <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Auſtria.</hi> Then did <hi>Matthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> leſs ſcrupulous than the <hi>Emperour,</hi> ſign the <hi>Articles</hi> of the <hi>Tranſaction</hi> of <hi>Vienna,</hi> adding there the expulſion of the <hi>Jeſuits;</hi> and received the <hi>Homage Ragotsky</hi> did him for his <hi>Principality.</hi> Soon after it was clearly ſeen, that <hi>Ragotsky</hi> deſpiſed worldly greatneſs; For being peaceable poſſeſſor of <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> equally cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Matthias</hi> and the <hi>Turk,</hi> he tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd his dignity to <hi>Gabriel Battory,</hi> having not Reigned above one year. <hi>Achmet,</hi> the <hi>Emperour</hi> of the <hi>Turks,</hi> confirmed this choice, and the <hi>King Matthias</hi> oppoſed it not. <hi>Battory</hi> was not ſo moderate as <hi>Ragotsky</hi> had thought him to be. He became inſupportable for his <hi>Letchery,</hi> and the honour of the moſt vertuous <hi>Matrons</hi> being no way ſecure under the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of a <hi>Prince</hi> ſo horribly debauched, they conſpired againſt his life, and he was aſſaſſinated at <hi>Valeneza</hi> Anno 1616. <hi>Bethlem Gabor,</hi> who had greatly contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to this Murther, ſeized on the <hi>Eſtate</hi> of the defunct.

               <p>This <hi>Tranſilvanian</hi> endeavour'd all his life-time to fiſh in troubled Waters. But the fortune of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the <hi>Emperour,</hi> having the aſcendent over his, he was forced in the end to buckle. Let us now ſee what hapned in thoſe parts, during the <hi>Reign</hi> of <hi>Ferdinand II.</hi> This <hi>Archduke</hi> was the moſt zealous <hi>Catholick</hi> in the World, and one that could the leaſt of any man ſuffer the Religions, which his Predeceſſors had connived at in their Countries. This zeal, and his good fortune, made the <hi>Emperour Matthias,</hi> his Couſin, prefer him, before all the other <hi>Princes</hi> of his <hi>Houſe;</hi> and who deſigning he ſhould be <hi>Emperour,</hi> after his death, cauſed him to be owned <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> before his deceaſe. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> began his Reign, with the oppreſſion of the <hi>Proteſtants:</hi> He commanded ſome of their <hi>Churches</hi> to be ſhut up, and demoliſhed ſome others in <hi>Bohemia.</hi> He recalled the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> into <hi>Hungary,</hi> and rejected thoſe <hi>Articles</hi> that favour'd the <hi>Religionaries,</hi>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:152568:72"/> in the <hi>Treaties</hi> made between the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours</hi> and the <hi>Hungarians</hi> and <hi>Bohemians.</hi> This proceeding having diſpleaſed a Body, which at that time was formidable, gave the <hi>Bohemians</hi> occaſion to prefer <hi>Frederick Elector Palatine,</hi> before <hi>Ferdinand:</hi> And immediately he beheld the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and <hi>Hungary</hi> before the walls of his <hi>Capital</hi> City. At the ſame time, <hi>Gabor,</hi> armed with the pretence of his <hi>Religion,</hi> entred into the <hi>League,</hi> and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed an Army of eighteen thouſand men, ſtrengthned with eighteen pieces of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> wherewith he entred into <hi>Hungary;</hi> and finding their ſpirits inclined to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, he made ſo great a progreſs, as gave him the confidence to be proclaimed <hi>King.</hi> During theſe tranſactions, <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> was at <hi>Francfort,</hi> where he was elected Emperour. And this <hi>election</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given him both authority and forces, he now thought only how to recover the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> he had newly loſt, and to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thoſe that had dared to attaque him. He loudly complained of the injuſtice of his adverſaries, and having remonſtrated to the <hi>Electors</hi> of the <hi>Empire,</hi> to the <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the juſt reaſons he had to regain his own, he drew into his party all the <hi>Catholicks</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> and even the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:152568:73"/> 
                  <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Saxony,</hi> who had been one of the main Pillars of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and held the ſwords of Foreigners within their Scab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berds. Soon after, the <hi>Elector Palatine,</hi> who had taken the Field with very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Forces, was put to flight. <hi>Gabor,</hi> made a ſtouter reſiſtance, and had brought the <hi>Emperours</hi> affairs to an ill condition, had his aſſociates plaid their part as well at <hi>Prague. Count Dampier, General</hi> of the <hi>Imperial</hi> Forces, loſt his life in going to view the <hi>Caſtle</hi> of <hi>Presburg,</hi> where <hi>Gabor</hi> had a Garriſon. And <hi>Charles de Longve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, Count Bucquoy,</hi> who after his ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Moravia,</hi> had made great progreſs in <hi>Hungary,</hi> died there being pierced with ſixteen wounds. The death of this great man, gave opportunity to <hi>Gabor</hi> to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver many places, to vanquiſh thoſe that oppoſed his deſigns, and range over the whole Countrey. But in fine, ſeeing his confederates put to flight, and his own Army much weakned, he demanded a <hi>Peace,</hi> and obtained it, Anno 1622. upon theſe following conditions. <hi>That he ſhould keep all</hi> Tranſilvania, Tokay, Caſſovia, <hi>and ſeven other</hi> Lordſhips <hi>in</hi> Hungary; <hi>That reſigning with the Crown the other Cities which he held in</hi> Hungary, <hi>he ſhould quit the name of</hi> King, <hi>contenting himſelf
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:152568:73"/> with that of</hi> Prince <hi>of the Empire, and the</hi> Principalities <hi>of</hi> Opelen <hi>and</hi> Ratibor, <hi>and that he ſhould reſtore the</hi> Jeſuits, <hi>where they had been ſetled before the War.</hi> This <hi>Peace</hi> laſted not long. <hi>Gabor</hi> gave up <hi>Vaccia</hi> to the <hi>Turk,</hi> who ſent him fourſcore thouſand men, which the <hi>Count de la Tour,</hi> had procured for him. With theſe Troops he invaded <hi>Hungary,</hi> alledging they had not made good to him what was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the <hi>Treaty</hi> of <hi>Odimburg;</hi> that they oppreſſed his <hi>Religion,</hi> and did not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the money to him, that was his due. The <hi>Emperour</hi> to prevent this growing miſchief, informed the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> that <hi>Gabor</hi> abuſed his Forces, whilſt he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taqued him without cauſe or reaſon; and adding his Sword to his words, forced his Enemy to an accommodation leſs advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous than the former. By this <hi>Treaty made in the year</hi> 1624. Gabor <hi>loſt the Title of</hi> Prince <hi>of the</hi> Empire, <hi>and ſome part of what had been granted him of</hi> Hungary. A while after this reſtleſs ſpirit joyned his Forces with thoſe of <hi>Charles Count Manſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field.</hi> But forty thouſand <hi>Tartars</hi> having been defeated by the <hi>Polanders,</hi> he was forced to quit that deſign, to goe and take a care of his Countries. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving enjoy'd the Company of <hi>Catharine,</hi>

And his death made it evident he equally reſpected the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi> and the <hi>Turk.</hi> To each of them he left a Horſe, the harneſs ſet with Jewels, and richly embroider'd, beſides forty thouſand <hi>Ducats</hi> in <hi>ſpecie.</hi> His <hi>Wife</hi> had of him an hundred thouſand pieces of <hi>Gold,</hi> of ſix pound value each, a hundred thouſand <hi>Crowns</hi> of Silver, and a hundred thouſand <hi>Florins,</hi> with three <hi>Lordſhips,</hi> which ſhe was to enjoy during life.</p>

               <p>When the <hi>Heirs</hi> to <hi>Principalities</hi> are uncertain, the death of the <hi>Prince</hi> is ever attended with trouble. <hi>Catharine,</hi> the Widow of <hi>Gabor</hi> not being capable to Reign, named <hi>Stephen Czac,</hi> to ſucceed
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:152568:74"/> her Husband, and deſired the <hi>Turk</hi> to confirm him: This <hi>Election</hi> diſpleaſed the <hi>Tranſilvanians,</hi> who divided their affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſome of them made choice of <hi>Stephen Bethlem,</hi> Brother of the late <hi>Prince;</hi> while others would rather have <hi>George Ragotsky.</hi> The firſt was ſo unfortunate, that his own Children roſe up againſt him; and the ſecond having overcome his adverſaries, complied with the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,</hi> gained the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s favour, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed <hi>Tranſilvania</hi> ſingly. Yet, was not his good fortune conſtant, <hi>Stephen Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> who had ſurrendred all his pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to him, killed one of his Relations; and fearing the juſt puniſhment which he deſerv'd, endeavour'd to avoid it by a bigger Crime. He craved aſſiſtance of the <hi>Port,</hi> who ſent him an Army of <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> with whom he beſieged <hi>Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ula. Ragotsky</hi> abhorring the infidelity of the <hi>Turk,</hi> ſubmitted himſelf to the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and received from thence three <hi>Regiments</hi> of Foot, and one of Horſe, to re-inforce his Army, with the which he deſtroy'd five and twenty thouſand <hi>Turks</hi> neer <hi>Szabuta.</hi> In fine, <hi>Bethlem,</hi> retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to his duty, was received into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and the <hi>Sultan</hi> confirmed <hi>Ragotsky</hi> in his <hi>Principality:</hi> During theſe occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:152568:75"/> the <hi>Emperour Ferdinand II.</hi> died, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for <hi>Succeſſour</hi> to the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi> and all his <hi>Eſtates, Ferdinand III.</hi> his <hi>Son.</hi> This <hi>Prince,</hi> who had a very dangerous War cut out for him in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> deſired to preſerve the <hi>Peace</hi> in <hi>Hungary;</hi> It was, notwithſtanding bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, by the advice of ſuch, as perſuaded him that he ought to forbid the <hi>Lutherans</hi> to frequent a <hi>Church,</hi> they had at <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh;</hi> and to revoke whatever had been promiſed in their favour. This policy appeared but very ill to ſuch as know, that even good acts do looſe of their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, when done out of ſeaſon. There is nothing that ſhocks men ſo much, as a violence againſt their <hi>Conſciences,</hi> and there are few things wherein we ought to have a greater circumſpection, than when we go about to reform Religion.

That <hi>Prince</hi> then believing himſelf to be more obliged to his Sect, than to his Friend and <hi>Benefactor,</hi> ſuffer'd himſelf to be over-perſuaded by the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates Ambaſſadors,</hi> who ſought his <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance;</hi> and having declared War againſt the <hi>Emperour,</hi> he entred <hi>Hungary</hi> with an Army of ſeventy thouſand fighting men. And that it might appear he did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the War without good reaſon; he by a <hi>Manifeſto</hi> ſet forth, that ſince the year 1619. they placed <hi>Hungary</hi> amongſt the <hi>Hereditary Provinces</hi> belonging to the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> that they beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Clergy,</hi> thoſe employments that appertained to the <hi>Laity,</hi> that they kept the <hi>Protestants</hi> out of all Offices; that they would not hear their complaints and grievances, and that againſt their Wills, and without any thing of their conſent or allowance, they had intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> into that Countrey. The firſt expedition of <hi>Ragotsky,</hi> was to ravage the Lands of <hi>George Homonay;</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which he ſubdued all that oppoſed him even to <hi>Caſſovia.</hi> The <hi>Emperour</hi> to put ſome ſtop to this torrent, oppoſed him

By the agreement they yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to <hi>Ragotsky</hi> ſeven <hi>Lordſhips</hi> in <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> in his favour they ſet open ninety <hi>Churches,</hi> wherein the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> might publickly teach their <hi>Doctrine;</hi> and the <hi>Hungarians</hi> were reſtored to their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges. This <hi>Treaty,</hi> ſeemed diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous to the <hi>Catholicks;</hi> but the <hi>Suedes</hi> felt the much greater inconvenience; for the <hi>Emperour</hi> having pluck'd this Thorn out of his Foot, relieved <hi>Brin,</hi> and forced <hi>Torſtenſon</hi> to raiſe the Siege he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med there.

It was then, that the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Vien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> deſiring to maintain <hi>Janos,</hi> without exaſperating the <hi>Ottomans,</hi> could effect neither the one, nor the other. <hi>Janos</hi> was loſt in a Battel, and the <hi>Turk</hi> was diſſatisfied with the <hi>Emperour,</hi> who, (as he ſaid) had infringed the <hi>Truce,</hi> which was between them. This miſunderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding heated both parties, and occaſioned ſeveral Embaſſies, and <hi>Negociations</hi> on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide. The <hi>Sultan</hi> declared that he intended nothing but to maintain the <hi>Peace;</hi> and his Subjects modeſtly complained of us, ſaying that we deſired a War, and they would make none, unleſs they were compell'd to it by neceſſity. During theſe wranglings, <hi>Nicholas Count Serini</hi> believed the War was already at our Doors, and imagining it would be ſome advantage to him, to build a <hi>Fort</hi> upon the Banks of the River <hi>Mur:</hi> he did ſo, and began ſome Hoſtilities. This <hi>Fort</hi> gave the <hi>Turk</hi> greater cauſe of complaint, who deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it ſhould be demoliſhed by a <hi>Chiaux,</hi> and by an <hi>Aga,</hi> whom I ſaw at <hi>Vienna,</hi> in the month of <hi>January</hi> one thouſand ſix hundred ſixty two. Theſe demands had no favourable anſwers; but it ſeemed as if they had talked to deaf man. And, to tell the truth, obſerving that haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:152568:77"/> and reſolution to give the <hi>Turk</hi> no ſatisfaction, I concluded that they would have a War; and that the <hi>Fort</hi> of <hi>Serini,</hi> was a place, would make work enough for ſeveral <hi>Ottoman</hi> Armies. Yet expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience hath ſhewed us, that the ſaid <hi>Fort</hi> was worth nothing, and that we had no need to undertake a War of ſuch impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for it. I ſhall not lay down the reaſons, becauſe any one may eaſily gueſs them. It ſhall ſuffice I tell you, that the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Vienna</hi> ſeeing the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Forces in <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> and fearing to be taken unprovided; they ſent the <hi>Counts de Montecuculi,</hi> and <hi>Souches,</hi> into the Field with two ſmall Bodies of men: But a good part of them were deſtroy'd without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a blow, or preventing the loſs of <hi>Kemin Janos,</hi> or the eſtabliſhment of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baffi.</hi> The <hi>Sultan,</hi> therefore ſeeing that <hi>Tranſilvania</hi> was in his power, and that <hi>Abaffi</hi> was faſt in the Saddle, and obliged to ſerve him, demanded again with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inſtance, that the <hi>Fort Serini</hi> ſhould be demoliſhed, and reparation made for the injuries, he ſaid, they had done him. For all this, could they not reſolve to grant him what he asked: ſo that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out more adoe, he reſolved to take his own ſatisfaction, and try whether his firſt
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:152568:78"/> Warlike enterprize, would prove as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, as he thought it juſt. He therefore began that War, which he proſecutes to this day, with much heat, and in which all <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> ſeems to have a ſhare. I conjure you to conſider ſeriouſly, what I have told you till this preſent, and I am confident you may rightly judge of the juſtice of both parties in this controverſie. We muſt now ſee, after what manner the <hi>Turk</hi> attaqued us in the year 1661. with what Forces we oppoſed him, and what either of them hath acted ſince the beginning of this War; that ſo you may the better apprehend what we are to fear; and what we may reaſonably hope.</p>

               <p>It ſeems to me, that the intereſt of his <hi>Imperial Majeſty</hi> obliged him to chuſe rather to demoliſh the <hi>Fort Serini,</hi> and give ſatisfaction as the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, than to enter into a <hi>War</hi> againſt him.

               <p>If it were reaſonable to meaſure <hi>Counſels,</hi> by the <hi>Events,</hi> we ſhould have juſt cauſe to blame that which was given
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:152568:78"/> at <hi>Vienna.</hi> But I gueſs, they did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that thoſe who had ſtood ſo long with their Arms acroſs, when they might have attaqu'd the <hi>Empire</hi> with advantage during the War, had a mind to meaſure their <hi>Cymitars</hi> with our <hi>Swords,</hi> when we were all in peace. We have notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſeen the contrary; and <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> IV. reſolved to begin the War by the rupture he made, after he had dallied with us a while: For to tell you the truth, I do not think but all his <hi>Embaſſies,</hi> and that great ſhow of moderation, were only to amuſe us. The quick ſighted judged rightly, that it was neceſſary to levy men; and the more ſtupid ſaid, that there was no truſting of ſuch, as have no faith in them. The <hi>Emperour</hi> finding he ſhould have need of aſſiſtance, deſired ſome; and the very formalities of giving, and of receiving it, was the cauſe they were not in a readineſs when the buſineſs began. The <hi>Confederates</hi> offer'd conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable forces, which they had already on foot; but they would have the command over them; and his Majeſty thought, that it would be an affront to his dignity to receive them upon thoſe terms. The <hi>Empire</hi> making the ſame offers, and the ſame demands, met with the ſame diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties;
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:152568:79"/> and from thence it came to paſs, that the <hi>Grand Vizier</hi> being advanced as far as upper <hi>Hungary,</hi> attacked <hi>Neuheuſel,</hi> by the <hi>Hungarians</hi> called <hi>Vivar;</hi> defeated three thouſand men, who made a ſally to ſurprize him, ſent ſome priſoners to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> as tokens of his <hi>Victory,</hi> and at laſt, forced the garriſon to ſurrender upon compoſition, and triumphed over that conſiderable place, which gave him opportunity to make inroads to the very gates of <hi>Vienna,</hi> and haraſs the <hi>Frontiers</hi> of <hi>Germany.</hi>

               <p>The Treaty that was concluded at <hi>Munſter</hi> upon the 24. of <hi>October</hi> 1648, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving yielded up ſome Lands to the <hi>French,</hi> and to the <hi>Suedes,</hi> as likewiſe to ſome Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> they all feared that the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> would repent
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:152568:79"/> the having bought ſuch a Peace: that they would endeavour to recover what had been diſmembred from the <hi>Empire;</hi> and that ſome others would demand what they had loſt. To obviate theſe inconveniences, the <hi>Cardinal Mazarin,</hi> perſuaded thoſe that had any cauſe of fear, and ſuch as deſired the peace of the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi> that it were fit they ſhould unite more cloſely, and engage to defend each other mutually, in caſe they ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be moleſted in the poſſeſſions of what the Treaty had adjudged to them. Ten or twelve <hi>Princes,</hi> as well <hi>Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks</hi> as <hi>Seculars,</hi> and of all <hi>Religions</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in the <hi>Empire,</hi> entred into this League. And every one having taxed himſelf proportionably to his forces, they to this purpoſe deſigned to have about five and twenty thouſand men, under the conduct of the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Salmes,</hi> and of <hi>Count Holach.</hi> The <hi>Emperour,</hi> to whom this thing was highly diſtaſtfull, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to diſſolve them, and not being able to compaſs the ſame, he endeavour'd to turn it to his own advantage. To this effect, finding he was now threatned with a War by the <hi>Turk,</hi> he remonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the approaching danger, and deſired thoſe Troops might be employed for the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:152568:80"/> defence of the <hi>Empire.</hi> The <hi>Confederates</hi> conſented thereto, upon condition they ſhould be ſworn to none but themſelves, nor ſhould be employed againſt any but the common enemy. On the contrary, his <hi>Majeſty</hi> deſiring they ſhould obey him abſolutely, and that they ſhould let him have them without any conditions; the buſineſs lingred ſo long, that they arrived very late in <hi>Hungary.</hi> They were then under the command of <hi>Wolfang Julius</hi> Count of <hi>Hollac,</hi> and made a ſeparate body from the <hi>Emperour</hi>'s, and thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the <hi>Empire.</hi> Whence you may judge, that although the greater part of thoſe that compoſed this <hi>League</hi> were <hi>German Princes,</hi> they were however cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as ſomewhat differing from the body of the <hi>Germans;</hi> becauſe ſeveral Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ſigned to it, and contributed to their maintenance; or becauſe the two <hi>Kings,</hi> who were parties concerned, had more power than all the reſt of the <hi>Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates</hi> together.</p>

               <p>That I may anſwer your queſtion in one entire diſcourſe, you muſt know, That the <hi>Turk</hi> having reſolved to cut us out work, he ſent his <hi>Grand Vizier</hi> into <hi>Hungary,</hi> who arrived at <hi>Belgrade</hi> the 8th of <hi>June.</hi> The <hi>Baron de Gois</hi> Ambaſſador from his <hi>Imperial Majeſty,</hi> came thither the day after; and the eighteenth he was conducted into the preſence of the <hi>Vizier.</hi> He had then on his left hand two of his <hi>Brothers,</hi> on his right the <hi>Mufti,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Perſon near two hundred <hi>Officers.</hi> In this firſt audience, the <hi>Baron</hi> having made his Complement to the <hi>Vizier,</hi> he told him, he was come thither to conclude the Treaty that had been begun betwixt him and <hi>Aly Baſſa.</hi> They let him know that it was too late, and that they would think further on it when they were upon our <hi>Frontiers.</hi> The <hi>Baron</hi> replied, they were then to blame to make him come thither, that he could not underſtand why they refuſed to conclude it, that they ſhould meet with greater difficulties when the War was begun: And that <hi>God</hi> would puniſh thoſe who ſhould be the cauſe of ſhedding innocent blood. The <hi>Grand Vizier</hi> anſwer'd, that he had weighed thoſe reaſons very maturely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> and that in caſe
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:152568:81"/> they would then have conſented, to what they now offer'd, he ſhould not have undertaken that journey. Neither would he hear any thing of the <hi>Treaty</hi> of <hi>Themiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>var,</hi> and made great complaints againſt thoſe that had broken the peace. Upon which the <hi>Baron</hi> ſaid, thoſe things had been urged before, and that they were fully anſwered. This is what paſſed at the firſt audience. To which the <hi>Vizier</hi> added, that the <hi>Baron</hi> might yet ſend an Expreſs to <hi>Vienna,</hi> and aſſure the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,</hi> that if he would lay down that ſum of money he would demand, evacuate all the places he yet held in <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> that of <hi>Zekelheid</hi> in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and raze the <hi>Fort Serini,</hi> there might be ſome means of making a Peace.</p>

               <p>I fanſie that by this propoſition the <hi>Vizier</hi> intended to amuſe the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> and that the <hi>Turk</hi> was not advanced into <hi>Hungary,</hi> with an Army of ſeventy thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men, and an hundred and thirty pieces of Cannon, to go back again with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtriking one blow.</p>

               <p>I believe ſo too, and do not think that an Officer, how great ſoever in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and reputation, durſt have taken any reſolutions contrary to thoſe his <hi>Maſter</hi> had preſcribed him. The Army there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:152568:81"/> began to file away upon the 11th of <hi>June</hi> in the year 1663. And this was done with ſo much pomp, that one would have judged it to conſiſt of two hundred thouſand fighting men. The noiſe of the <hi>Camels,</hi> the <hi>Horſes,</hi> and the <hi>Mules,</hi> the ratling of the <hi>Drums</hi> and <hi>Timbals,</hi> and the ſound of their <hi>Trumpets,</hi> laſted both day and night till the eighteenth of the ſame month. The <hi>Officers</hi> moved ſlowly, and although ſome or other marched every day, they were moſt of them <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s with their equipage, which being magnificent, made a ſtately ſhow, and appeared great to admiration. In fine, the <hi>Aga</hi> of the <hi>Janizaries</hi> parted the fifteenth with four thouſand of his companions, and was followed by the reſt of the Army till the eighteenth, at which time the <hi>Grand Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier</hi> went on his way, with a moſt royal magnificence. He ſent a thouſand foot before him, with each a led horſe or two in their hands. After theſe marched the <hi>Spahi-Alagarſi,</hi> who is General of thoſe <hi>Gentlemen</hi> that ſerve on horſeback, prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by his great <hi>Standard,</hi> and followed by ſix hundred <hi>Spahi-Edeli,</hi> who are the moſt valiant of all <hi>Turky,</hi> having their <hi>Cornets</hi> very prettily adorned. Theſe were followed by a long Staff, at the top
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:152568:82"/> whereof was a large braſs button, from whence hung down a <hi>Horſe-tail.</hi> Soon after were ſeeen two great <hi>Guidons,</hi> which they carried before the <hi>Vizier</hi>'s Brothers, and other Perſons of Quality and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, who were accompanied by ſeven hundred <hi>Haſvadars,</hi> or Valets, moſt of them covered with Coats of Mail, from the crown of the head, down to the knees. At laſt the <hi>Grand Vizier</hi>'s Enſigns and Guidons marched, and were immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followed by ſixteen led Horſes, with Saddles and Houſins embroider'd with Gold, and Precious Stones. The Grooms that led them, had Cloath of Gold Veſts, and Breeches of Crimſon Velvet. Eight of the <hi>Vizier</hi>'s Footmen had the like cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and he went in the midſt of theſe, accompanied by two <hi>Janizaries,</hi> wearing upon his head a <hi>Turban</hi> of great price. After the <hi>Vizier</hi> came the <hi>Roſevendy,</hi> or great <hi>Chancellor;</hi> the <hi>Teſdatir,</hi> or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary General, and ſome other of the principal <hi>Officers</hi> of the Army: The <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of the <hi>Chamber,</hi> all young Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of twenty or thirty years, cover'd with Jacquets: Six hundred <hi>Haſvadars,</hi> forty <hi>Cimbaliſts</hi> and <hi>Trumpeters;</hi> two hundred ordinary Horſe-men, and three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore Horſes, that carried the <hi>Grand Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier</hi>'s
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:152568:82"/> 
                  <hi>Tents</hi> and <hi>Pavillions.</hi> With this mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent and dreadfull train, he arrived at <hi>Bukovar</hi> the four and twentieth; and there he was informed by the <hi>Aga</hi> whom he had ſent to the <hi>Cham</hi> of <hi>Tartary,</hi> that inſtead of fourſcore thouſand men he had promiſed, he would ſend ten thouſand, under the conduct of his Son. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe he made for not keeping his word was, that the white <hi>Tartars</hi> and the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites,</hi> had made ſome incurſions into his Countrey, which obliged him to keep his men for the defence of his <hi>Frontiers.</hi> Two days after he got to <hi>Eſeck,</hi> where he ſojourned eight or ten days, waiting for ſuch as were to joyn him. At laſt he paſſed the <hi>Bridge,</hi> which is above twelve thouſand paces in length, and arrived at <hi>Buda</hi> the fifteenth of <hi>July.</hi> There it was, that after they had held divers <hi>Councils,</hi> the Siege of <hi>Neuhuſel</hi> was reſolved, and the ſeventh of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the place was inveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Three thouſand men whom the <hi>Counts Forgats, Palfi,</hi> and the <hi>Marquis Pio,</hi> commanded to ſurprize the Enemy, fell into their <hi>Nets,</hi> and were maſſacred, and taken Priſoners. And the place was ſo cloſely begirt, that they were forced to capitulate, and ſurrender upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition the 18. of <hi>September,</hi> in the ſame year.</p>

               <p>It is probable they might have held out longer: but there being no relief to be expected, they muſt in fine, have been compell'd to ſubmit to their Enemies. They endured three aſſaults, wherein the <hi>Turks</hi> were vigorouſly repulſed. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Count Forgats</hi> their Governour was confin'd, and accuſed for not having done his duty in that Siege. But I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it was more his unhappineſs, than his Crime, that loſt it: It was reported here, when this ſtrong <hi>Fortreſs</hi> was taken, that the Officers were young, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out experience. And on the contrary the <hi>Vizier</hi> was a Perſon about the Age of five and thirty, active, and diligent in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions, skilfull in the Mathematicks, of an heroick courage; and who was day and night in the Trenches, both to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage his Soldiers, and to ſhew them a brave example. This place being taken, he cauſed ſeven pieces of Cannon to be fired in token of <hi>Victory.</hi> And having ſent one of his Brothers to the <hi>Port,</hi> to carry the news of it to the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> he began to repair the Breaches; and then retired, to prepare himſelf for the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:152568:83"/> next <hi>Campagne.</hi> This loſs awakened the <hi>Empire,</hi> which ſeemed to have lain aſleep, and the Diet having been called at <hi>Ratiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi> ſome of the <hi>Princes</hi> appeared there in Perſon, the reſt by their <hi>Ambaſſadors.</hi> There was the magnificence of our <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> to be ſeen: For although the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour</hi> had deſired the <hi>Potentates</hi> to come without any pomp, yet nothing appeared but what was brave and ſtately. Divers old <hi>Officers</hi> came to offer their <hi>Swords</hi> to the <hi>Emperour.</hi> And thoſe <hi>Princes</hi> who were no ſtrangers to the ſmell of <hi>Gun-powder</hi> preſented themſelves to command the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Number and merit of the pretenders did as much puzzle his Majeſty in the liberty of his choice, as the great variety of <hi>Flowers</hi> in Summer does the Ladies in a curious Garden. He muſt however reſolve, and chuſe Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for the new Bodies they were going to raiſe. The <hi>Emperour</hi> who had already three Armies under the conduct of the <hi>Counts de Serini, Montecuculi</hi> and <hi>Souches,</hi> deſired to make them more capable to undertake ſomewhat extraordinary. To this end, without changing the inferiour Officers, and leaving the Sovereign com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to theſe Counts, he joyned with them <hi>Philip Prince Palatine</hi> of the branch
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:152568:84"/> of <hi>Sultzbac,</hi> and Count <hi>Spar,</hi> perſons of merit and great reputation. The firſt commanded his <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s Horſe, in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of <hi>Captain General,</hi> and the other led the Foot, and the <hi>Cannon.

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:152568:90"/> City of <hi>Neuheuſel</hi> in upper <hi>Hungary,</hi> and had ſeen that <hi>Province</hi> plundred, and deſtroyed by Fire and the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Sword, whilſt himſelf was not able to defend it. So that judging he ſhould not be in a capacity to make good this <hi>Campagne</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch numerous forces, nor avoid the fatal conſequences of the ſtorm that threatned him, he went perſonally to the <hi>Diet</hi> of <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> to reſolve with the <hi>Electors,</hi> what means they might beſt take to preſerve the <hi>Empire</hi> from the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching danger: ſoon after this <hi>Diet,</hi> there were levies made all over <hi>Germany,</hi> and the <hi>French King,</hi> as <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Alſatia,</hi> obliged himſelf to furniſh eight <hi>Companies,</hi> and forty <hi>Cornets</hi> of Horſe, which were to make up a body of ſix thouſand Men, to be defraid during the whole <hi>Campagne</hi> at the expence of his <hi>Majeſty.</hi> The <hi>Count de Coligny</hi> had the command of them, and under him <hi>de la Fueillade,</hi> and <hi>Bodvis Mareſhals de Camp.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All the young <hi>Gentlemen</hi> about the <hi>Court</hi> ſtrove to be taken into this ſervice, ſome to pleaſe the <hi>King,</hi> others out of their inclination, and a third ſort from the example of the former, which was now become ſuch a kind of neceſſity, the younger ſort could hardly decline it.</p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:152568:91"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Coligny</hi> arrived at <hi>Metz</hi> the 25th of <hi>April,</hi> where the Horſe, and thoſe that went <hi>Voluntiers</hi> in this expedition, waited for him.</p>
               <p>All theſe were divided into ten <hi>Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons,</hi> and the <hi>Squadrons</hi> into four <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gades,</hi> under <hi>de Gaſſion, Desfourneaux,</hi> and <hi>de Beauvezé.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They received Orders to march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Colmar,</hi> a City in <hi>Alſatia,</hi> which refuſed to ſubmit to the conditions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to them by the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin,</hi> Governour of that Province.</p>
               <p>Now to paſs over the particulars of their March, which is not very material, the <hi>French</hi> came at length near the famous City of <hi>Vienna,</hi> and encamped within a League of that place, where the ſix Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments of <hi>Piedmont, Eſpernon, Grancé,</hi> and the reſt were joyned, and after two days reſpite, they went forwards. The Emperour being come thither to Hunt, and lodge near their Quarters, ſaw the ſaid ſix Regiments in <hi>Battalia,</hi> and the next day came again accompanied by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers perſons of quality, and his ordinary Guards.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Emperour</hi> then preſſed <hi>Monſieur de Coligny</hi> to go and joyn the <hi>German</hi> Army, which lay encamped behind the Fort
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:152568:91"/> 
                  <hi>Serin.</hi> The <hi>Turks</hi> did afterwards attack it, and raiſed alſo the ſiege of <hi>Caniſia,</hi> and about the beginning of <hi>July,</hi> news came it was taken by aſſault, though aſſiſted by the Imperial Army. Seven or eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of the Men that were to maintain it periſhed, and the greateſt part of thoſe that endeavour'd to retire towards the Bridge, which made the communication between the Fort and the Army were cut off. This unwelcome news retarded their March, and it was certainly dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to go to <hi>Markburg,</hi> as had been intended, to wait for the Horſe that were coming from <hi>Italy,</hi> and thoſe other that parted from us at <hi>Donavert</hi> when the Foot embarqued.</p>
               <p>Being in the <hi>French</hi> Army my ſelf, I ſhall, and cannot forbear, to call it our Army, for which you muſt excuſe me, and therefore to go on, I muſt let you know, that after conſultation, they chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their former meaſures, and took their road by the Mountains of <hi>Styria</hi> towards <hi>Rakelsburg.</hi> We began this march upon the ſeventh of <hi>July</hi> by the Plain near <hi>Neuſtadt,</hi> and the ſame day paſſed the River <hi>Leytha,</hi> which parts <hi>Auſtria</hi> from <hi>Hungary.</hi> From thence we went on by <hi>Odemburg,</hi> which is a pretty large Town,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:152568:92"/> and ſo towards <hi>Furſtenfelt;</hi> a City fortified with ſix Baſtions, but ill ſituated.</p>
               <p>From thence our march was very troubleſome through the Mountains to <hi>Rakelsburgh,</hi> where we arrived on the nine and twentieth. It is ſituate in an Iſland, encompaſſed by the River <hi>Muer,</hi> towards the Plain it is fortified with ſome Baſtions, and half Moons, the Ditches are large, deep, and full of Water. The left arm of the River paſſes within a little diſtance of the Out-works, the right is nearer yet: but the Fortifications on this ſide are not ſo good as the other; and they were then at work with great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence: and beſides, this place is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a high piece of ground, within Muſquet-ſhot, upon which ſtands a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, guarded by ſome Out-forts, built at the point of the hill which faces the Town.</p>
               <p>After the <hi>Turks</hi> had taken, and razed the great Fort of <hi>Serini,</hi> the Imperial Army repaſſed the <hi>Muer,</hi> to draw the nearer to <hi>Rakelsburg,</hi> and cover the Countrey the moſt expoſed to the incurſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the enemies.</p>
               <p>This Movement gave <hi>Coligny</hi> the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter facility to joyn them, which he did upon the 22d day of <hi>July,</hi> ſo ſoon as he
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:152568:92"/> was informed of the news, by <hi>Monſieur de Bodvis,</hi> whom he had ſent purpoſely for intelligence.</p>
               <p>When we joyned the Army, they were encamped in one Line; the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi>'s forces had the right; thoſe of the <hi>Empire</hi> were in the midſt, commanded by the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Baden;</hi> and ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Allies had the left, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by <hi>Count Hollach;</hi> ours poſted themſelves upon the left of theſe laſt.</p>
               <p>On the three and twentieth word was brought to the General <hi>Montecuculi,</hi> that the <hi>Turks</hi> marched along the River <hi>Raab</hi> to find an eaſie paſſage, with deſign to enter the Countrey. He took a reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to march with all the Horſe towards <hi>Kermain,</hi> a little Town ſituate upon the River, and leave the Foot and Baggage, with orders to follow him in haſte.</p>
               <p>The ſeven and twentieth, <hi>Spork,</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the <hi>German</hi> Foot, who conducted them, ſent to <hi>la Fueillade</hi> to march im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, becauſe he had notice that the Enemy approached: and to confirm the Meſſage, he order'd ſome Volleys of Cannon to be fired from their Camp at St. <hi>Gottard,</hi> where they arrived that morning. This advice obliged us to leave the Baggage with a ſlender guard,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:152568:93"/> and haſten the march, to joyn the reſt of the forces at St. <hi>Gottard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They encamped very cloſe to avoid ſome hills which reigned all along the face of the Camp, and were of too large extent to be poſſeſſed by the Infantry of three Armies.</p>
               <p>Our Troops had the left of the Camp, which was on the Enemies ſide. The night was ſpent in making an intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and by morning it was pretty well finiſhed.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the City Bridges were repairing, the place being but ſmall and much ruined. Its ſituation is at the confluence of the <hi>Raab,</hi> and the <hi>Laufsnitz:</hi> but whatever diligence they uſed in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up the Bridges, the ſame could not be compleated till the morning of the eight and twentieth.</p>
               <p>Then the Baggage began to go forward, and took up the paſſage for a whole day. The following night two thouſand Foot were commanded to go and joyn the Horſe at <hi>Kermain.</hi> But ſcarce had they began their march, when news came, that the Enemy, after they had been repulſed at <hi>Kermain,</hi> marched directly along the River to St. <hi>Gottard.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:152568:93"/>
               <p>This action was honourable to the <hi>French</hi> Horſe, the <hi>Turks</hi> attempting their paſſage in two ſeveral places directly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them: the one being towards the Bridge they were repairing, and which was guarded by ſome <hi>Hungarians;</hi> the other at a Ford below it; and to favour the <hi>Tartars</hi> in this paſſage, who had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken it, they had cauſed a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble body of <hi>Janizaries</hi> to advance to the brink of the River, who by their fire, thought to have made themſelves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. They were repulſed every where with great vigour, and for want of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry to oppoſe them, there were ſome Horſe commanded to ſerve on Foot with Muſquetoons, the better to maintain this attack, where the <hi>Sieur de la Chau,</hi> a Captain who had the guard of the Ford, with fourſcore <hi>Maiſtres,</hi> bravely repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all that endeavour'd to paſs.</p>
               <p>In this combat the Enemies loſt a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw,</hi> named <hi>Iſmael,</hi> and ſome conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable perſons on our ſide were ſlain: the <hi>Chevalier de Saint Aignan,</hi> and <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur de Chaſteau-neuf Aide de Camp, de Sault</hi> and <hi>de Treville</hi> were wounded.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> after they had in vain at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted the paſſages, continued their march along the River, to find one
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:152568:94"/> more convenient nearer the Spring-head; the ſeaſon was very unfit for their deſign, becauſe that River running at the foot of the <hi>Styrian Mountains,</hi> ſwells upon the leaſt Rains: and was now ſo full by the ſhowers that had fallen ſome days before, that it was fordable in few places. <hi>Montecuculi</hi> ſent us notice of their march, which was confirmed by the burning of ſuch Villages as they met with in their way, which gave us the alarm, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged all the Army to make ready for the defence of our Camp, which was in a place of great diſadvantage, by reaſon of thoſe high grounds which commanded it. All the reſt of the day and night the Souldiers ſtood to their Arms, although the Enemies made no attempt upon us.</p>
               <p>The Horſe, who had taken their way by land, and were ſeparated from the Foot at <hi>Donavert,</hi> did this day joyn the Army, having left part of their Baggage behind, to march with the greater ſpeed. In the mean time the Baggage belonging to the Army was gotten over the Bridges, and upon the nine and twentieth the troops began in the morning to march towards the Camp, which had been marked out on the other ſide of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and hardly were the firſt of them
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:152568:94"/> gotten over, but the Van-guard of the Enemies began to appear upon thoſe higher grounds before mentioned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>General Spork,</hi> who had ſtaid in the Camp with the <hi>German</hi> Foot, cauſed ſome volleys of Cannon to be fired upon the moſt advanced, and afterwards retired to follow the reſt of the Army, the <hi>Turks</hi> not offering to moleſt them.</p>
               <p>About ten of the clock, our Horſe, who obſerved their march, encamped in ſuch a manner, that they took up the ground which was oppoſite to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Camp.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time, they made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of the River by placing ſtrong guards at convenient diſtances, which took up the whole extent of the Front; and we paſſed the reſt of all that day in firing our Guns at them, without any great effect.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> Camp appeared to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in two lines; but the diſtances were not equal and regular like ours; ſome parts were better furniſhed than others, in groſs, and without order, moſt of the Souldiers have Tents, painted green, or ſome other colour.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Grand Vizier</hi> was encamped in the centre, and the <hi>Janizaries</hi> near him.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:152568:95"/> His principal Tent, which glittered in the Sun, appeared to be of Crimſon Silk, it was accompanied with many others of different colour'd ſtuffs, joyned by Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries ſhut up with an encloſure of green ſtuff, like a Wall of ſeven or eight foot in height; and round about this Park were an infinite number of Tents, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a kind of a large City in the midſt of that numerous Army, compoſed of well nigh an hundred thouſand men.</p>
               <p>All this might eaſily be diſcerned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Camps, though ſeparated by the River, were not far aſunder, and that of the <hi>Turks</hi> was raiſed in form of an Amphitheatre upon the hills ſide which they had poſſeſſed. But, that which is wonderfull, is, that all theſe vaſt Buildings are ſet up, or taken down in a very ſhort time.</p>
               <p>They march ordinarily in great Bodies, without obſerving any regular diſtance: each body hath its Drum, which is very large, and becauſe they beat but two ſtrokes at a certain long diſtance of time, the noiſe of them is accompanied with<note n="*" place="margin">A ſmall ſhrill braſs Trumpet.</note> 
                  <hi>Clarions.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:152568:95"/>
               <p>At the head of their greater Troops, they carry a world of red and white Enſigns, where for the moſt part they have a Body of <hi>Tartars,</hi> of whom they make uſe to over-run and ſpoil an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Countrey, and to march on the wings of their Army.</p>
               <p>They are a people fit for thoſe expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for beſides that they are uſed to Fatigues, they are mounted upon very ſwift Horſes, and well winded, on whoſe backs they ſwim over moſt Rivers. Few of them have any Fire-arms, and for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive weapons, moſt of them uſe only Arrows, beſides which they carry a Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitar by their ſide, and another faſtned to their horſes Gyrths, to uſe upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: Some of them have Javelins alſo, or Half-pikes, which they dart with great force and skill. Their manner of fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not to ſtand their ground; ſo ſoon as they are charged, they ſcatter in an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Prince of <hi>Baden,</hi> ſeeing them paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſent immediately to give notice to
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:152568:98"/> 
                  <hi>Monſieur de Coligny</hi> of the ill ſtate of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and that no time was to be loſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Coligny</hi> was obliged in ſo preſſing a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to ſend the neareſt Regiments to his aid; <hi>Eſpagny, Grancé</hi> and <hi>Thurenne</hi> marched thither with all diligence, and at firſt coming reſtored the face of affairs, and even drove the Enemy out of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſures of the Village; but after they had withſtood their efforts for a time, they were conſtrained to retire towards the Houſes: So that in the laſt charge, the Regiments of <hi>Eſpagny</hi> and <hi>Grancé,</hi> were ſo roughly handled, that being not in a condition to maintain their poſt, <hi>Monſieur de Guitry,</hi> had orders to cauſe the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>la Ferté</hi> to advance, whom they had poſted lower towards the banks of the River. Upon his arrival; he ſeized on the Gardens which had been diſputed and began to fire very ſmartly at the Enemy, who during theſe ſeveral attacks, had filled the Plain with the beſt forces that had gotten over, and they had in divers parts been caſting up ſeveral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments pretty nigh to one another, and laying a Bridge below the Ford: Notice being given to the Generals, by the <hi>Marquis de la Ferté,</hi> it was reſolved to go and attack them in the Plain, ſince
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:152568:98"/> it was impoſſible otherwiſe to drive them out of that poſt, where they had ſo well ſecured themſelves. <hi>Monſieur de la Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eillade,</hi> whoſe turn it was that day, brought the Order, which was executed with ſo little reflexion, and after ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate a manner, that they expoſed thoſe foot Companies as a prey to the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> horſe, had not the <hi>French</hi> Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons, commanded by <hi>Beauvezé,</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by two of the <hi>German</hi> Squadrons, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced immediately before that Infantry, as ſoon as they ſaw them paſt the Hedges and Defiles, although their Orders were only to ſecond them. The Regiment of <hi>Thurenne</hi> had the right hand of the attack towards the Wood, and was ſuſtained by another of <hi>Germans.</hi> The paſſage was not very open, <hi>Grancé</hi> and <hi>Eſpagny</hi> had the midſt, and <hi>La Ferté</hi> had the left to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the River, where they were to paſs by a way which would not admit of above five or ſix men in front. Part of this laſt Regiment marched directly to an entrenchment of the Enemies, where they fired very thick, whilſt the reſt of their men drew up in <hi>Battalia</hi> behind them: but becauſe they could not get to them without dividing, by reaſon of the inconveniency of the place, this diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:152568:99"/> added to the novelty of a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and fierce Enemy, put the Officers to a great deal of trouble to get the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers on, who beheld the two <hi>German</hi> Regiments under their feet that had been defeated in the firſt attack: the dead ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all their heads cut off, were laid in order of Battel upon the ſame ground they were to paſs over, to march to the Enemy.</p>
               <p>Our Horſe, in the mean time, who were advanced (as I ſaid) before the Foot, charged the <hi>Turks</hi> with ſo much vigour, that notwithſtanding their great numbers, they were ſhatter'd. The movement they made by giving ground a little, gave the Souldiers much courage, and then the Foot made ſuch continual diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges as put them wholly into diſorder: For being us'd to come to handy blows they could not endure to ſtand againſt ſuch firing: And upon the ſecond charge of our Horſe their whole body began to give way, and turn their Heads toward the River, and the retrenchments they had made upon the left within forty pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of each other.</p>
               <p>When they were driven into that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, they had no other choice, but either to make good their retrenchments, or
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:152568:99"/> fling themſelves into the Water. This was the cauſe of that obſtinate reſiſtance they made, beſides that they were help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their ſhot from the great retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which raked all along from the other ſide of the River, whereby the Regiment of <hi>La Ferte,</hi> was much incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moded, however they gained the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments on this ſide, though the laſt of them was defended for a long time by the Enemies, and that was the laſt effort they made in this Battel. For af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that they were totally diſorder'd in all parts, and caſt themſelves in great crowds into the River, whoſe ſtream is very rapid, it was wholly cover'd with them for above an hour; the greateſt part were drowned, the remainders periſh'd by our Soldiers, who fired inceſſantly upon ſuch as endeavour'd to gain the farther ſhore, the ground being pretty ſteep on either ſide.</p>
               <p>The terrour and conſternation grew ſo univerſal, at laſt, in their whole Army, that without conſidering whether it were eaſie for our Troops to paſs the River and follow them, they abandoned their great retrenchment on the other ſide, and the two Batteries, they had made there, not daring to return the night fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:152568:100"/> during which, by reaſon of the obſcurity and the continual rains, they might have carried off their Cannon, without the leaſt knowledge of any one.</p>
               <p>The Combat laſted about four hours, and concluded with a conſiderable loſs on either hand, above ſix thouſand of the beſt of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and the greater part of the youth who were near the grand Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier, and had paſſed the River, fell in this Battel: and we had twelve, or fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred wounded or ſlain; amongſt others the Count <hi>de Mouchy</hi> a Colonel, and the Count of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> the Marquis <hi>Villeroy</hi> was wounded with an Arrow: The Counts <hi>de Serry</hi> and <hi>Beauvezé</hi> were hurt, <hi>Meſſieurs de Bouillon</hi> made themſelves famous by their valiant performances.</p>
               <p>The better part of the Succeſs of this illuſtrious Action is owing to the <hi>French</hi> Nation, who though but few in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and without any very conſiderable aſſiſtance of the Imperialiſts, were able to overcome an Enemy entrenched, and who had the advantages of the place. Who by their taking of the Fort <hi>Serini,</hi> had ſtruck all the <hi>German</hi> Provinces with terrour, as well as the Emperour's Army. The new raiſed <hi>German</hi> Regiments ran a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way above two leagues from the Camp,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:152568:100"/> during the fight, though they were not attacked. The Generals with the reſt of the troops expected the event. Their baggage was loaden, and every one was rather conſidering how to make their eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, than any ways to aſſiſt thoſe that fought, and although ſuch a retreat muſt have been difficult to be put in execution before an Enemy puff'd up with good Succeſs, and who do ordinarily fight with impetuoſity; nevertheleſs the Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts had a deſign of throwing up a work before them in haſte, from thoſe woods which lay near them, to the River ſide; and our <hi>French</hi> to ſecure a paſſage for themſelves upon the River of <hi>Laufnitz,</hi> had left the Regiment of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> to guard the head of the Bridge, near St. <hi>Godthard,</hi> where the baggage and the reſt of the troops, were to paſs, to get to <hi>Furſtenfelt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The defeat and rout of the Enemies, which they had ſcarce faith to believe at firſt, deliver'd all of us from thoſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and cares, and every one was ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with this good fortune, that they did not ſo much as conſider, whether it were fit to make uſe of this advantage, and paſs over ſome Forces at this Ford which the Enemies had abandon'd, and
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:152568:101"/> likewiſe at St. <hi>Godthard,</hi> to attack the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Camp, where the terrour was ſo great, that the <hi>Vizier</hi> cauſed ſeveral prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Officers to be put to death in his own preſence, who notwithſtanding all he could urge, were preparing to flye. It is moſt certain, that if they had made uſe of this conſternation, as it was eaſie to have done, we might that very day have gained the greateſt Victory, that any Chriſtian Army hath obtained for a long time, againſt the Infidels: But they were ſatisfied with guarding only thoſe paſſes they had won with their Infantry, which they did all the night in great quietneſs, the <hi>Turks</hi> not making the leaſt attempt to recover their Cannon they had left behind, in their great retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. During the above mentioned fight, the <hi>Turks</hi> had ſent ſome troops di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly over againſt the Imperial Camp, who were charged and defeated by <hi>Spork,</hi> General of the Horſe, who compell'd them to repaſs the River.</p>
               <p>The next day, being the ſecond of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the Enemy removed their Camp out of the Valley, and poſted themſelves upon the higher ground, where they planted their Guns, which they fired the whole day upon thoſe works we had
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:152568:101"/> made to ſecure the troops who guarded the paſſage.</p>
               <p>The day after they continued the ſame thing, though the Cannon had but the ſame effect, and at midnight they began to decamp, and marched the ſame way, as they came.</p>
               <p>Our Army did on this ſide the River, make the ſame movements as they, and thus they marched in ſight of each other till the ſeventh, when the Enemies reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red towards <hi>Caniſia:</hi> and there being great ſcarcity amongſt our men, they were order'd to march along the <hi>Raab,</hi> that they might get proviſions and forrage, they remained till the twentieth in the Villages neighbouring to <hi>Oedemburg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About the end of the Month, they marched towards <hi>Presburg,</hi> along the ſhore of the Lake <hi>Neuſidleſee,</hi> which is ſeven leagues in compaſs, and derives its name from the abundance of Fiſh taken there. And in the beginning of <hi>September</hi> the Armies being encamped near <hi>Virtemburg,</hi> there came News that the Enemies were to paſs the <hi>Danube</hi> at <hi>Gran,</hi> to enter upon <hi>Hungary;</hi> this made them change the deſign they had concluded on to march along that River to the Cities of <hi>Raab,</hi> and <hi>Comorra,</hi> and to paſs afterwards over
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:152568:102"/> a Bridge of Boats at <hi>Presburg,</hi> and oppoſe their deſigns.</p>
               <p>They marched therefore near <hi>Hueſen</hi> and <hi>Tirnaw,</hi> towards the River <hi>Vagh,</hi> which runs near <hi>Neuheuſel,</hi> and falls into the <hi>Danube</hi> above <hi>Comorra.</hi> Then did there come intelligence that the <hi>Turks</hi> had paſſed, but none could preciſely tell what their reſolutions were; it was at firſt believed they would beſiege <hi>Levens,</hi> ſituate between <hi>Neuheuſel</hi> and <hi>Gran,</hi> which had been taken at the beginning of the <hi>Campagne</hi> by Count <hi>Souches,</hi> but in the end we underſtood that it was but a party which they had detached to rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force <hi>Neuheuſel,</hi> and poſt themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind it to hinder the beſieging it.</p>
               <p>A great train of Artillery which the Emperour ſent to his Army, had given them this jealouſie: They were then poſted at the Mouth of the <hi>Vagh,</hi> behind was a Bridge on the <hi>Danube</hi> to paſs into the Iſland of <hi>Schut,</hi> where the Forces under Count <hi>Souches</hi> were encamped. This re-inforcement made them delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate to go and attack the <hi>Turks</hi> in their poſt, and ſeveral days were vainly ſpent in theſe deliberations, there being always ſome obſtacle or other that hindred the execution, and as if there had been ſome
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:152568:102"/> conteſts between Count <hi>Montecuculi,</hi> and the Commanders of the <hi>French</hi> Forces, who ſuffer'd very much after the Battel, and demanded proviſions with great ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs: It was perceived that this <hi>Italian</hi> General, ſubtile no doubt, but of that ſort of ſubtilty ordinary in thoſe of his Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and fitter for the Cabinet Council, than at the head of an Army, intended nothing leſs, than to march againſt the Enemy, and who affected that pretence ſo much, only becauſe he ſaw the Army ſo haraſſed and weather-beaten, that thereby he might in ſome ſort diminiſh the honour they had acquired at St. <hi>Godthard,</hi> by the reproaches he made, that we were the cauſe of hindring that deſign; he indeed nobly propoſed it the firſt, though he had no mind to put it in practiſe, as being aſſured that a Treaty of Peace was then on foot, which had for ſome time been ſecretly managed for his Maſter: But the better to conceal his intentions he had marched towards the head of the <hi>Vagh,</hi> making a ſhow as if he would draw nearer the Enemy, for that purpoſe. The <hi>French</hi> Troops being ill guided in this march, found themſelves upon the two and twentieth within five little leagues of <hi>Neuheuſel,</hi> and diſtant
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:152568:103"/> from the reſt of the Army above two, in danger of being ſurprized, becauſe the River that lay before them was fordable in many places, and the miſtake was not found out till towards noon. <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur de Coligny</hi> being fallen ſick, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to <hi>Tirnau: Monſieur de la Fueillade</hi> in his abſcence cauſed them forthwith to march off, and rejoyn the groſs of the Army, the <hi>Turks</hi> not having attempted any thing upon us: They had ſome few days before, defeated a party of <hi>German</hi> Horſe, and by the return of ſome of thoſe Priſoners we firſt heard the News of the Peace in the Camp, and the Ceſſation of Arms was proclaimed upon the thirtieth of <hi>September,</hi> the conditions thereof were as follows.</p>
